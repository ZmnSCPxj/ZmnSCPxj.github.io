<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Current version of Bitcoin, allows later transaction to be
written that spends an earlier transaction,
even if the earlier transaction has no signatures yet.
This feature allows a general pattern for various protocols, the
Funding Transaction pattern, which provides <em>private</em>
enforcement of contracts out-of-chain, with the
only visible onchain presence being a SegWit N-of-N multisignature
address being spent to one or more standard addresses.</p>
<p>Study of various protocols suggests that this technique is
general, and can be used to enforce any contract expressible in
Bitcoin SCRIPT in a private and offchain manner.</p>
<h2>The Funding Transaction Pattern</h2>
<p>The Funding Transaction pattern solves problems like:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Protocols that require non-standard SCRIPT programs reduce
     the anonymity set of their users.</li>
 <li>Blockchain space is expensive in general.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Funding Transaction pattern describes how to solve such
problems:</p>
<ol>
 <li>The complicated SCRIPT programs needed by a protocol are
     kept offchain, and are rooted from a specific transaction
     output that requires signoff of all protocol participants
     (a standard N-of-N multisignature output).
     Only this transaction, the <dfn>funding transaction</dfn>,
     is confirmed onchain at the end of the protocol setup
     stage.</li>
 <li>Successful completion of the protocol leads to the creation
     of a simple spend, of the multisignature N-of-N output
     directly to standard addresses for each participant that
     should receive funds based on the protocol.
     This increases privacy and reduces cost.</li>
 <li>Protocol setup requires that all offchain transactions be
     completely written and signed before the funding transaction
     is signed and confirmed on the blockchain.
     This ensures that application of the offchain transactions
     is atomic.</li>
 <li>Stalls in the protocol are recoverable by enforcing the
     protocol rules using the non-standard SCRIPT programs, at
     some loss in privacy and increased cost due to the
     appearance of non-standard outputs onchain.</li>
</ol>


<h1>The Funding Transaction on Lightning</h1>
<p>In the
<a href='https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/00-introduction.md'>Lightning
Network protocol</a>, channels are opened by the confirmation of a
<a href='https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md#channel-establishment'>funding
transaction</a>.
This is a transaction with a "funding output", which is a simple
payment to a
<a href='https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/03-transactions.md#funding-transaction-output'>2-of-2
multisignature P2WSH address</a>.</p>
<p>The protocol for opening a channel involves creating the
funding transaction, then creating and signing the initial
commitment transactions, and finally signing and broadcasting
the funding transaction.
This order of steps ensures that there is no need for trust
to open channels: by the time the funding transaction can be
validly broadcast on the base Bitcoin blockchain network, a
way for either side to back out of the channel without
cooperation from the other already exists, in case one side
or the other stalls within the protocol.</p>
<p>Lightning also supports a bilateral close: in this case,
both sides coordinate to create a
<a href='https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/03-transactions.md#closing-transaction'>closing
transaction</a>.
This is a simple transaction that spends the funding output
and splits it up according to the final channel state
agreed upon by both side of the channel.
It looks like a spend of a 2-of-2 multisignature address to
one or two pay-to-witness-public-key-hash addresses.
Since a commitment transaction exists that either side can
push on the blockchain, there is no incentive for the
other side to refuse to create and sign the closing
transaction.
There is also an incentive to cooperate: if the protocol is
completed, the onchain transaction looks no different from
an ordinary spend of a 2-of-2 multisignature address to
one or more pay-to-witness-public-key-hash addresses.</p>
<p>While participants on the Lightning Network will be informed
of opening and closing of channels, non-participants, as well
as monitors that start monitoring the Lightning Network after
the channel has closed, will not be able to differentiate the
historical participation in the Lightning Network from
many onchain transactions.
This also forces those performing analysis on Bitcoin
transfers to store the data acquired from Lightning Network
for themselves as early as possible, in contrast with
blockchain analysis where historical data is widely
available on every Bitcoin fullnode, with analyzers not
needing to store the historical data themselves.</p>

<h1>The Funding Transaction in CoinSwapCS</h1>
<p>The CoinSwap protocol used in <a href='https://github.com/AdamISZ/CoinSwapCS/'>CoinSwapCS</a>
is described in <a href='https://github.com/AdamISZ/CoinSwapCS/blob/master/docs/coinswap_new.pdf'>this
PDF file</a>.
Below is a graphic from that PDF file.</p>
<img src='coinswap_new.png' />
<p>Of particular note is that the CoinSwapCS protocol
has many similarities to the pattern as
the transactions of Lightning Network:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The TX-2 (spending TX-0) and TX-3 (spending TX-1)
     transactions must be written and signed, before the
     transaction they are spending (TX-0 and TX-1
     respectively) is broadcast and confirmed.</li>
 <li>The TX-2 and TX-3 transactions are kept offchain
     (not broadcasted on the Bitoin network) until the
     protocol terminates.</li>
 <li>The existence of TX-2 and TX-3 allows a measure of
     trustlessness: in case one side stalls, the TX-2
     or TX-3 transaction can be broadcast and spent to
     recover funds.</li>
 <li>The cooperative case TX-4 and TX-5 transactions are
     broadcast on the blockchain on normal conclusion of
     the protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus in CoinSwapCS, TX-0 and TX-1 serve the role of
funding transaction.
Like in Lightning, there are transactions (TX-2 and TX-3)
which enforce adherence to the protocol, but in usual
operation are not broadcast over the network.
Finally, in usual operation, simple transactions (TX-4
and TX-5) paying out directly to the destination are
written in order to complete the protocol.</p>
<p>CoinSwapCS moves the enforcement contracts offchain
for a privacy boost, since swaps become linkable if the
enforcement contracts are revealed and spent.</p>

<h1>The Funding Transaction in Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer Channel Factories</h1>
<p>In a
<a href='https://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/a20a865ce40d40c8f942cf206a7cba96/Scalable_Funding_Of_Blockchain_Micropayment_Networks%20(1).pdf'>paper
released in 2017</a>, Burchert, Decker, and Wattenhofer
present the concept of channel factories.
Channel factories are composed of at least three
participants, who aggregate their funds together into a
<dfn>hook transaction</dfn>, and then form channels between them
using the aggregated funds in an <dfn>allocation transaction</dfn>.
Channels may then be implemented using existing
payment channel protocols, such as Poon-Dryja channels
used by Lightning.
The entire channel factory can be closed cooperatively
by all participants using a <dfn>settlement transaction</dfn>.
Below is an example image from the paper; circles are transaction
outputs, circle color indicates required signatory to spend,
with multicolor circles requiring an N-of-N signature:</p>
<img src='burchert-decker-wattenhofer.png' />
<p>Hook transactions follow the same pattern of
funding transactions in Lightning and CoinSwapCS
protocols: they pay out to an N-of-N multisignature,
offchain transactions ensure correct adherence to
the protocol, and in normal operation, termination
of the protocol creates a simple transaction that
spends directly to standard addresses owned by the
participants.
The above graphic looks suggestively similar to the
CoinSwapCS graphic, with TX-0 being replaced with
the hook transaction, TX-2 being replaced with the
allocation transaction and the commitment transactions,
and TX-4 being replaced with the settlement transaction.</p>

<h1>Requirements on the Blockchain</h1>
<p>In order to use the Funding Transaction pattern, at
the minimum transaction malleability in all forms must
be eliminated.
This is sufficient for protocols where the funding
transaction is funded by only one participant in the
protocol, such as in CoinSwapCS and in the current
version 1.0 of the Lightning BOLT specifications.
A malleability fix is needed since there are offchain
transactions that would get invalidated if a transaction
is malleated, preventing enforcement of the protocol.</p>
<p>For protocols where the funding transaction is funded
by multiple participants, a more stringent requirement
is needed: the ability to refer to transactions before
they are signed, with the signed version having the
same transaction ID as the unsigned version.
These protocols include the Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer
channel factories, as well as future versions of Lightning
that will allow channels to be started with funding from
both sides of the channel.
Such protocols require that signing the funding transaction
be the final step in protocol setup, with the successful
confirmation of the funding transaction initiating the rest
of the protocol.</p>
<p>Features such as SegWit, FlexTrans, or BIP140 provide
the latter feature, in addition to a malleability fix.
Thus in general one of those features should be preferred
in order to allow general use of the Funding Transaction
pattern.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The Funding Transaction pattern allows the enforcement
of a contract supported by the blockchain while providing
privacy by not actually exposing the contracts onchain in
the normal case.
It also generally has the side effect of requiring only a
sequence of two transactions onchain in the cooperative
case.</p>
