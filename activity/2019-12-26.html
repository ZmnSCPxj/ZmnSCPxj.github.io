<h1>2019-12-20 to 2019-12-26</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, relatively low activity this week.
It seems likely to also have low activity for a few more weeks due to
various pre-scheduled circumstances.</p>

<h2>Path Privacy on Lightning</h2>
<p>As mentioned in previous log, this is something I have taken an
interest in.
I have created a lengthy
<a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-December/002408.html'>article
on lightning-dev regarding this topic</a>.</p>
<p>This includes a number of various possible improvements that might
help payment privacy on Lightning.</p>
<p>Another thing I am working on is returning the previous behavior
of <code>pay</code> on C-Lightning, where it started with a large
route randomization <code>fuzzpercent</code>, then lowers it if the
<code>maxfeepercent</code> or <code>maxdelay</code> have been violated.
While I have coded this already, creating a test for this has
been delayed somewhat, due to the next item.</p>

<h2>BOLT Regression on <code>final_expiry_too_soon</code></h2>
<p>A <a href='https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/commit/6729755f0c0228df0686176e99032fb368ca056a'>recent
change in BOLT 4</a> merged the <code>final_expiry_too_soon</code>
failure code into the <code>incorrect_or_unknown_payment_details</code>
failure code.</p>
<p>The problem is that <code>final_expiry_too_soon</code> did not have
the <code>PERM</code> bit set.
This means it is not a permanent error, which makes sense.
The most usual cause of this error is the following sequence of
events:</p>
<p><ol>
<li><p>You send out a multi-hop payment.</p></li>
<li><p>Before the payment reaches the final destination,
miners are able to find a block.</p></li>
<li><p>The block propagates over the network faster than your payment
does, because of Bitcoin FIBRE, or because some of the forwarding
nodes are flaky.</p></li>
<li><p>The payment reaches the final destination, which now has fewer
blocks to claim its payment.</p></li>
</ol></p>
<p>The above sequence of events is very unlikely, but is still a
possible edge case.</p>
<p>Before, this was handled &ldquo;normally&rdquo; by C-Lightning
(and presumably other implementations) because
<code>final_expiry_too_soon</code> did not have the <code>PERM</code>
bit set.
Because that bit is not set, it was not considered a permanent error,
and thus the <code>pay</code> implementation would retry in that
situation.</p>
<p>However, the linked commit in lightning-rfc requires that we now
use <code>incorrect_or_unknown_payment_details</code> to report this
failure case.
<code>incorrect_or_unknown_payment_details</code> has the
<code>PERM</code> bit set, meaning it is now classified as a permanent
failure.
Because this failure is now a permanent failure, the
<code>pay</code> implementation will not retry &mdash; after all,
the failure is marked as permanent!
But in fact this sub-case is actually a transient problem that
should eventually get fixed once the payer node catches up to
the latest blockchain state.
The Real Bug is that we are now reporting a transient problem
using a failure code that has the <code>PERM</code> bit set,
which is inaccurate (because that should only be set for permanent
errors).
Of course, having this as a separate failure code lead to
privacy leaks, so we are forced to accept this now-permanent
failure code for a transient problem.</p>
<p>Fortuitously Nicolas Dorier had a test case that tickled this
edge case, and reported it in
<a href='https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/3367'>C-Lighntning#3367</a>.</p>
<p>The solution is to special-case this failure mode.
If <code>incorrect_or_final_payment_details</code> is the failure
code returned, we should try to check if the returned <code>height</code>
is higher than the height <em>before</em> we sent the payment.
The returned height is the block height that the destination knows.
If the destination has a higher block height than what the block
height was <em>before</em> we sent the payment, we should instead
consider it as this previously-non-permanent failure.</p>
