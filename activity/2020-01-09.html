<h1>2019-12-27 to 2020-01-09</h1>
<p>Not actually a <em>weekly</em> log this time.
The week from 2019-12-27 to 2020-01-02 had no useful activity, thus
did not bother to log.
Most activity below is for the week 2020-01-03 to 2020-01-09.</p>

<h2>New Hardware Arrival</h2>
<p>One of the new hardware I purchased with Square Crypto provided funds
arrived in this week.
So I have started setting it up for my development environment,
e.g. installing <code>vim</code>, <code>screen</code>, and other essentials.</p>
<p>Other pieces of new hardware will be coming soon, this is the first of
the new hardware, which is significant as now I am running a bonafide archiving
Bitcoin full node on this new hardware!
Once I can allocate a few coins I will also start running a C-Lightning node.</p>
<p>Steve suggested boosting <code>dbcache</code>, which seems to have helped,
and now I am saturating the download limit imposed by the ISP, incidentally
the ISP contract is again paid for with Square Crypto provided funds.
Hopefully initial block download will complete by the time I publish this
log.</p>
<p>The new hardware is a definite step up in speed from what I have been
using for development.
Boot up takes less than 5 seconds from entry of disk encryption pasword,
shut down takes 2 seconds or less.
Starting of applications and so on is almost instant.
I am now able to run <code>make check</code> on
<code>ElementsProject/lightning</code>
(I had opted for a long-term support OS for my previous dev env,
unfortunately it meant most tools were older than the test suite of
C-Lightning wants, in any case Travis is still quite good and is still
faster than even this new hardware).</p>
<p>The new hardware is not configured to support proper hibernation
out-of-the-box, but hopefully I just need to do some OS excision of
some sort to make that work.
It forgets the keyboard exists when getting out of sleep (thus the system
is rendered useless until power-cycled), but I do not use sleep anyway and
strongly prefer hibernate, so will focus on that instead.</p>
<p>Of course this is new hardware to live in, so of course a good part
of my time was spent playing with it and tweaking it, sorry, will
actually continue developing more Bitcoin software soon as well, just
let me enjoy this new hardware a little.</p>
<p>Small amount of time was also spent tracking incoming shipment
for this particular piece of hardware as well as the status of the
other incoming new hardware.</p>
<p>My intent is that I will copy the blocks and chainstate from this
hardware to the other incoming hardware, and use that as the main
server; in effect, this just lets me start with a full node on the
other incoming new hardware faster.
I am not quite certain what to do with the node on this hardware
once I have switched the full node over to the other new hardwaer
&mdash; there is no &ldquo;real&rdquo; point to running more than
one node, after all
&mdash; perhaps I will prune the node on this current new hardware,
or delete it completely, or just keep it as an extra archive copy.</p>

<h2>Government Papers Handling</h2>
<p>Various necessary paperwork as needed by our governmental overlords.
The government demands its pound of flesh, and since I started receiving
Square Crypto funds in the previous year, the necessary paperwork and
the tribute<!-- taxation is theft! --> to the government that
protects<!-- ha, ha --> my rights needs
to be handled after the end of that year (i.e. the start of this year).
Some hours were spent in this and related activity.
Hopefully as I learn more about how this all works it will take less time
in the future.</p>

<h2>Guidance for BOLT Spec and Other Topics</h2>
<p>0 or more people have been asking guidance from me regarding parts of the
BOLT spec, and the Lightning Poon-Dryja mechanism as well as those
details of the Bitcoin that materially affect how Lightning is implemented.
The BOLT spec is not a good place to start learning about Lightning, but it
remains the most comprehensive and detailed description of what Lightning
currently is.
A good part of my time that was not visible as activity on C-Lightning or
the lightning-dev mailing list was spent here.</p>
<p>0 or more people also asked about some interesting cryptocurrency topics,
mostly not likely to be implemented in Bitcoin.
Some of these were similar to some kind of amalgam between sidechains and
offchain updateable cryptocurrency systems (i.e. &ldquo;channels&rdquo;),
where sidechain operators/functionaries/miners/whatever-they-are have some
stake that could potentially get slashed if they misbehave.
(the stake, if my understanding is correct, would even be locked in the
mainchain, and is thus similar to my old mainstake idea).</p>
<p>Personally, the reason I am primarily developing Lightning rather than
sidechains is that, after some reflection, I realized that sidechains are
just putting more blockchains in existence, and blockchains are not efficient
at transferring funds;
the reason we tolerate <em>one</em> blockchain is not because of its
efficiency of fund transfer (it is not efficient at this task), but because
of the permissionless censorship-resistance, as well as the ability to
enforce a fixed supply schedule.
One can observe that my oldest writings on this site are primarily related
to sidechains, and that those have not been updated at all, and that I am
now far more prolific in Lightning development.
Lightning, I believe, is a powerful layering of tradeoffs: the Lightning
layer provides efficient fund transfer, and because we can always drop
onchain rather quickly, we can approach (though not quite meet) the
security and censorship-resistance of the blockchain layer.</p>

<h2>BOLT Regression on <code>final_expiry_too_soon</code></h2>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href='2019-12-26.htl'>previous log</a>.</p>
<p>The code for this was already complete, and Nicolas Dorier has already
confirmed the fix was working for his tests (and added the change to his
distribution of C-Lightning 0.8.0 embedded in BtcPayServer).
However, we also needed tests in the C-Lightning test suite.
The ones I was writing were not triggering the case as often as I would
have liked, but anyway Christian Decker pointed that our test
harness actually allows the <code>bitcoind</code> model to stop informing
new blocks to the C-Lightning after test, which allows us to trigger
this situation reliably.
With this, pull request
<a href='https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/3376'>#3376</a>
is now a complete pull request.</p>
<p>It is still not merged, as properly it needs an ACK from someone who
we know has been staring at C-Lightning code for a good while.
I would also be more comfortable if another C-Lightning core developer
were to actually merge it in as well, as the code addition is not trivial.</p>
<p>In any case, I always strive to at least fix a bug before adding a few
features.
As we all know, adding a feature always risks introducing a bug, one only
needs to remember SegWit2X
(&ldquo;not just twice the blocksize but twice the softforks!&rdquo;
good thing they thought twice about pushing it).
Getting into this practice of &ldquo;fix a bug before you add a feature&rdquo;
lets us at least mitigate the above effect.</p>

<h2>Multiple Channel Opens in One Transaction</h2>
<p>An old feature requested in
<a href='https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/1936'>#1936</a>
by my good friend Rene Pickhardt.
This is quite possible now to do &ldquo;manually&rdquo;, with the
introduction of the <code>fundchannel_start</code>, <code>fundchannel_complete</code>,
and <code>fundchannel_cancel</code> commands, as well as the split of withdrawal
into <code>txprepare</code> and <code>txsend</code>, but of course a unified
command to do this should really be provided out-of-the-box by C-Lightning.</p>
<p>Now, because such a <code>multifundchannel</code> command would be communicating
with multiple separate peers, it would be quite a good bit better to start those
interactions simultaneously for all the peers to be channeled to.
The core C-Lightning <code>lightningd</code> daemon can deal with this 100% fine,
since we launch a new process for every peer, but the plugin library for C
is not able to have a single plugin-provided command launch multiple commands to
the C-Lightning daemon in parallel, only in series.</p>
<p>(the plugin library can handle multiple parallel instances of the same plugin-provided
command, but each such command can only have one C-Lightning command in-flight at a time.)</p>
<p>Thus I propose in
<a href='https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/3401'>#3401</a>
to add the capability to have a plugin-provided command launch multiple
&ldquo;threads&rdquo; that can independently block on a C-Lightning command.
The plugin library already has this capability &mdash; multiple instances of a
plugin-provided command can run concurrently already &mdash; but it is not
well-exposed.
These are not &ldquo;real&rdquo; threads as well, they are more similar to how
Hugs98 implements multiple Haskell <code>IO</code> threads (i.e. sometimes called
&ldquo;green threads&rdquo; as the OS has no knowledge of these and we just
effectively execute in continuation-passing style to allow arbitrary scheduling
of the rest of the computation).</p>
<p>This will not only benefit <code>multifundchannel</code> and allow us to
initiate parts of the channel-opening protocol to multiple peers concurrently,
in the future it would likely get easier to implement multipath payments by
having multiple try-and-try-again part-payment &ldquo;threads&rdquo; running,
then possibly giving up and then have a parent control &ldquo;thread&rdquo; decide
to split the payment differently.</p>
<p>In any case this is what I am currently working on, hopefully it will end up
being a decent interface.</p>

<h2>Lightning Path Privacy</h2>
<p>As well, I am still thinking of path privacy on Lightning.</p>
<p>A thought I have been having is that, if the surveillor controls multiple
nodes on the network, <em>and</em> we do not have path decorrelation yet,
then if a payment passes through more than one surveillor node, then the analysis
needed by the surveillor is vastly sinplified.</p>
<p>In particular, if the surveillor controls nodes S1 and S2, and you made a
payment A -&gt; B -&gt; S1 -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E -&gt; S2 -&gt; F, then the
surveillor only needs to consider the incoming path B -&gt; S1 and the
outgoing path S2 -&gt; F to guess the payer and payee.
No matter how long the path is between S1 and S2, the surveillor will not have
any degradation in the information it can extract.</p>
<p>This is relevant since some of the thinking around path privacy has been
about increasing path length in order to spread risk and make it harder for
surveillors to utilize the shortest-path heuristic.</p>
<p>I find I am somewhat ambivalent about this technique of &ldquo;just always
increase the path length&rdquo;.
The intuition is that the fewer people you tell about your payment, the more
private you would be.
Indeed, if you had a direct channel between payer and payee, and used only
that single hop for all payments (without just increasing the path length)
you have maximal privacy since nobody else can know about the state of your
channel and about any payments you make through it.
Thus we should avoid route randomization if there is a viable direct single
channel from payer to payee.
But having direct channels with every payee you want to pay is not scalable,
so we really do need intermediaries.</p>
<p>Increasing path length increases the number of people you tell about
your payment, which increases the chances that you will inadvertently
tell more than one node that is controlled by a single surveillor.
And if you tell two nodes from a single surveillor about your payment,
they can eliminate every node in-between them from analysis, meaning
any extra path length between the two cooperating
surveillors is &ldquo;wasted&rdquo;, you are paying higher fees without
increasing your privacy against that surveillor.</p>
<p>Increasing path length also reduces the reliability of your payments
and increases the chance that a node will forward, then drop from the
network before the payment claim can be returned to it, leaving your
payment stuck, potentially until the timelock on your HTLC.
Finally, increasing path length tends to increase the timelock at your
outgoing HTLC, meaning that the worst-case for payment stuck increases.</p>
<p>I take it as a given that any surveillor would run multiple
Lightning Network nodes.
We already know that surveillors run multiple Bitcoin full nodes to
try and triangulate what nodes source what transactions;
I fully expect that the same will be true for Lightning.
The Lightning case <em>is</em> mitigated somewhat by the fact that
running a Lightning Network node requires allocating some funds,
but that mitigation is counter-mitigated by the observation that
the more funds you allocate to a Lightning Network node, the more
fees you earn from forwarding (in general), thus does not impose an
opportunity cost.</p>
<p>Of course, the above is only relevant <em>if</em> payment
decorrelation is not yet prevalent on the network.</p>
<hr />
<p>In a future <em>with</em> payment decorrelation, of course,
surveillors running multiple nodes will not be able to easily
determine if two forwards on two different nodes they control
belong to the same payment attempt.
In that case, they can only continue to use the shortest-path
heuristic to determine if the two forwards belong to the same
single payment.
This implies that, in a payment decorrelation future, adding
extra length to your path that happens to lie between two
surveilling nodes is now beneficial, as this frustrates the
shortest-path heuristic and prevents the surveilling nodes
from realizing that two forward attempts are in fact belonging
to the same single payment.</p>
<p>So does this vindicate &ldquo;just always increase the path
length&rdquo;?
Not quite, I believe.</p>
<p>The only thing that the surveillor sees is actually just
two forwards, B -&gt; S1 -&gt; C and E -&gt; S2 -&gt; F.
To apply the shortest-path heuristic, the surveillor will
check if the outgoing amount and CLTV S1 -&gt; C, minus the
incoming amount and CLTV E -&gt; S2, is what would be
expected if the shortest path between S1 and S2 were taken.
Remember, the onion format is still unbroken, so S1 cannot
in fact see the exact path it is going into after its hop.
If the change in amount and CLTV matches what would happen
if the shortest path between S1 and S2 had been taken,
then the surveillor can determine that both forwards belong
to the same payment.</p>
<p>Thus, if the path S1 -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E -&gt; S2
were <em>not</em> the shortest path between S1 and S2, then
the surveillor might be fooled into thinking that the two
forwards might actually be from two unrelated payments.</p>
<p>(note that amount correlation and timing correlation still
leaks even if you do not take the shortest path, so the
surveillor might still suspect that those forwards still
belong to the same payment; baby steps, but at least some
progress)</p.
<p>But given that all the surveillor sees is just its own
forwards, this gives us an opportunity to fool the surveillor
without <em>actually</em> increasing path length.
We only need to extend shadow routing, which increases the
amount and CLTV at the end of the route, to possibly working
on intermediate nodes as well.</p>
<p>More concretely: suppose the shortest path between S1 and
S2 is actually S1 -&gt; C -&gt; E -&gt; S2 (i.e. the previous
example path was not the shortest path).
If we <em>overpay</em> the fees and CLTV at C, such that it
<em>looks like</em> the path went through the &gt;extra&lt;
node D, but still use the shortest path S1 -&gt; C -&gt; E
-&gt; S2,
then what S1 sees at its outgoing HTLC is still a non-shortest
path!</p>
<p>That is, by overpaying hop nodes randomly, using the same
shadow routing algorithm, we can &ldquo;virtually&rdquo;
increase our path length without &ldquo;actually&rdquo;
increasing our path length.
This is an advantage since if we take the shortest path
&ldquo;actually&rdquo;, we (1) reduce risk of payment
failure (mo hops mo problems) and (2) reduce risk that
we will inadvertently inform multiple surveillors of our
payment.
But surveillors cannot see the actual path, only infer
it from the CLTV and amount deltas, so they see the
length of the &ldquo;virtual&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, having the shortest path length is still a
risk, even if we virtually increase its apparent length;
a sufficiently powerful surveillor might control all nodes
on your path, in which case virtual increases in apparent
length will automatically be seen and found.
To get around the sufficiently powerful surveillor, you
need to actually increase path length, not just virtually
increase it, so that you now have a chance to have a node
that is <em>not</em> controlled by the surveillor.
But I suspect this is easily avoided by simply ensuring
your path length is at least 3, and using the shortest
path <em>actually</em> if the shortest path is 3 or more
hops (and just using extended shadow routing to virtually
extend it);
I doubt a sufficiently powerful surveillor would dominate
over the network that much (but I may be naive).</p>

<h2>An MPP Splitting Proposal</h2>
<p>Rene recently
<a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-December/002406.html'>posted
his research about a node balance measure</a>.
Since my position is that a &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;, non-proactive
rebalance (i.e. &ldquo;JIT Routing&rdquo;) is still better, I
was not quite as excited about it myself.</p>
<p>However, thinking further on the ramifications of JIT
Routing led me to realize that, at any arbitrary time, a
payer would likely be in an unbalanced position, at least by
the measure that Rene proposes.
Now, proactive balancing is basically the speculation that
payments are equally likely to occur in all directions,
then buying a position on the Lightning Network based on
this assumption.
I believe JIT Routing is superior in that it actually
first waits for a signal that payments will be done in a
particular direction before making such a purchase.</p>
<p>But the &ldquo;equally likely&rdquo; assumption is
actually sound!
It reflects what we expect, that every customer will be
the employee of some provider that has its own customers:
the money just goes round and round as products are
transformed and routed in the reverse direction.
Thus, waiting until we encounter
some other event &mdash; a forward (JIT Routing) or a payment
&mdash; and <em>then</em> ride a rebalance on top of that,
seems like a good idea.</p>
<p>So I asked Rene on the mailinglist about using his
measure to guide multipath payments, which excited him
and made him produce some
<a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-January/002418.html'>actual
code to model this</a>.</p>
<p>This is quite a good thing, as it removes an objection I
have against multipath, specifically that there is no clear
policy about how to split the payment.
JIT Routing at least has a very clear policy on when it
triggers: if you have a forward that you would fail because
of insufficient funds, you do a rebalance.</p>
<p>So it seems to me to be a good thing, though I still
think JIT Routing is better than a proactive rebalancing.</p>
<p>I observe as well that JIT Routing is not so different
from making a payment, so it coudl use this same algorithm
as well to guide where it gets its funds for rebalancing.</p>
