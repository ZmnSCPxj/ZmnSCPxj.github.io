<h2>Mah Fullnode</h2>
<p>Fullnode is up and running and is now also behind a Tor .onion address, and is not
accessible over the open IPv4 or IPv6 networks.</p>
<p>Setting up the Tor .onion address is easy, but <em>confirming</em> you are set up
safely reachable behind the .onion is surprisingly difficult.
In particular, <a href='https://bitnodes.earn.com'>bitnodes</a> does not reliably detect
.onion nodes: it claims my .onion node is down.
With some assistance from Matt Corallo, I determined that my .onion node is actually
quite up and reachable.</p>
<p>Since revealing your IP increases the probability of nasty people attacking you and
your node, I believe that running over .onion only is a basic precaution that every
fullnode operator must do.
Setting up Bitcoin Core to run over Tor is easy and a lot of guides exist for that, but
<em>checking</em> that you did it correctly is hard:
as mentioned <a href='https://bitnodes.earn.com'>bitnodes</a> is not reliable when
dealing with .onion-only fullnodes,
and you might not get a lot of inbound connections until a good bit later, so
you will be waiting a long time trying to catch an inbound connection on
<code>getpeerinfo</code> just to assuage yourself
that you have it set up correctly.
So here is some other ways to confirm you have been set up:</p>
<p><ul>
  <li><p>Ask someone who is already running a fullnode over Tor to run
         <code>addnode <em>your.onion:8333</em> onetry</code> in their Bitcoin.
         If they can connect, then you have been successfully set up over that
         .onion.
         Obviously now they know the .onion address of your fullnode, so only do this
         if you trust them not to attach your .onion address to your identity.</p></li>
  <li><p>Check your own <code>getnetworkinfo</code>.
         There will be a <code>localaddresses</code> field.
         Make sure it contains only your own .onion (and not any IPv4 or IPv6 addresses).
         If the <code>score</code> for your .onion is greater than 4,
         it means at least one other node has connected to it at least once in the
         past.
         It will take a good bit for this to increment, but note that you might not
         be looking at your computer at the exact moment that an inbound peer connects,
         so this is a good approximation that at least one peer has managed to get in
         touch with your fullnode while you were not watching.</p></li>
</ul></p>
<p>According to Matt .onion addresses are at a disadvantage, since nodes will generally
avoid gossiping about remote peers that they have not actually tried to connect to,
and obviously those nodes can only try .onion addresses if they have Tor installed, and
not a lot of people actually install Tor.
So .onion addresses will propagate over the network much more slowly than IPv4 or
IPv6 addresses.
In any case inbound connections <em>will</em> arrive eventually, just longer, and now
that I have been running my fullnode continuously for about a week I have two inboud
connections.</p>
<p>As well, I have installed and running a JoinMarket maker for a few days already.
No takers yet, sadly, probably I need to earn more money in other ways first
before I can see some takers coming to me.
JoinMarket maker supposedly only does outgoing connections, and the sample
configuration file guides you on how to connect over Tor.
Hopefully this means my maker is just out there waiting for somebody to take its
offer, but so far profits have been 0.</p>
<p>I also set up Electrum Personal Server for my hardware wallet, which gives me good
privacy for my hardware wallet finally.
Installing for my hardware wallet involved installing some drivers,
and necessitated a reboot.
I am still trying to figure out how to update the firmware without connecting to
the manufacturer web-wallet though.</p>
<p>Next step is to get some funds that I can put into a Lightning node
and actually start running C-Lightning.</p>
<p>I observe as well that the location I have installed my hardware suffers from
power interruptions once every one or two weeks, so acquiring some kind of
uninterruptible power supply may be a good idea.</p>

<h2>Advice</h2>
<p>As well, 0 or more people have been asking advice regarding topics related to
Bitcoin, Lightning, consensus, scaling, and so on.
Again, a good part of my time that cannot be seen as activity on-list or on-github
is spent on such informal mentoring activities.</p>
<p>At least one person in particular asked about thermodynamics-based consensus and
how to easily explain it to e.g. elementary school level humans.
I thereby came up with a <a href='2020-01-16/fable.html'>fable</a>.</p>

<h2>Preparations for Bitcoin Core Dev and 2020</h2>
<p>Steve Lee offerred to have Square Crypto sponsor a trip to the USA to
attend Bitcoin Core Dev and Bitcoin 2020 conference.
Thus, at least part of my time was spent studying the requirements to get my
current meat puppet a visa to the USA.</p>
<p>The USA has relatively draconian policies for granting visas,
thus there is a chance that my current meat puppet will be unable to acquire one.
However, I do intend to make a best-effort attempt to acquire a visa
and attend these events.</p>

<h2>Hardware Signers for Lightning</h2>
<p>0 or more people have brought up hardware signers in various venues recently,
so I decided to take some time to actually figure out how a hardware signers can work
with Lightning, resulting in
<a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-January/002425.html'>this
spam article on lightning-dev</a>.</p>
<p>The
<a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-January/002427.html'>reply
from Devrandom</a> is quite helpful for this topic as well,
and is arguably more relevant,
since Devrandom and Ken Sedgwick are both actively working on these.</p>

<h2><code>multifundchannel</code> for C-Lightning</h2>
<p>I.e.
<a href='https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/1936'>#1936</a>.</p>
<p>I have implemented a &ldquo;spark&rdquo; system already to allow concurrent
execution of commands from within a <code<libplugin</code>-based plugin.
As well, I have implemented a &ldquo;step&rdquo; system to allow easily
specifying tasks to be done in sequence for a command.</p>
<p>You can view my
<a href='https://github.com/ZmnSCPxj/lightning/tree/multifundchannel'>work-in-progress
branch</a>,
though if you are reading this log entry long after the date I post this log,
note that I have a habit of deleting branches once their pull requests have been
closed.</p>

<h2>Tamas Blummer</h2>
<p>Tamas Blummer died a few days ago.
Though I have not worked closely with him for long,
we did plan out part of
<a href='https://github.com/defiads/defiads'>defiads</a>
together prior to its public announcement.
I am saddened by this loss.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope to advance the development of defiads,
which of course requires me to learn Rust in earnest.</p>
