<h1>2020-01-17 to 2020-01-23</h1>

<h2>Mah Fullnode<em><strong>s</strong></em></h2>
<p>Second hardware arrived this week as well, meaning a good amount of time
was spent setting it up for development as well
(<code>screen</code>, <code>vim</code>, <code>git</code>...).
First to set up of course was SSH and Tor.
I also set up a new Bitcoin Core fullnode on this as well.</p>
<p>As I did not have a large-enough portable storage device I copied
the <code>blocks</code> directory over via local network and SSH.
This was a mistake, it seems some bottleneck along the way limited
the transfer to not much faster than the ISP speed anyway, meaning
it was not much faster versus just re-downloading the entire
blockchain.
As well, the copy of <code>chainstate</code> was not done properly
it seems, thus I was forced to run with <code>-reindex-chainstate</code>,
leading to even longer setup time, making me regret this.</p>
<p>At least the new hardware has the Bitcoin Core running as a
<code>systemctl</code> service, which is much helpful in case of a
power interruption or other restart condition.
Further, the new fullnode was started behind a .onion hidden
service from its creation, which I think is quite good.</p>
<p>I set up as well an SSH daemon over a Tor hidden service, to allow
to communicate both hardware even if they are later placed in separate
networks.
Though using an SSH daemon over Tor turns out to have high latency,
so mostly useful only for quick <code>scp</code> between them.</p>
<p>As well, this new hardware came pre-installed with a long-term support OS,
meaning its package versions are old.
However, I have since discovered
<a href='https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv'>pyenv</a>, which allows
installing a Python version that is different from the OS-installed,
thus allowing the system to run JoinMarket and ElectrumX, which are
the next items I will install and run here.
As of now JoinMarket is running and I have transferred the JoinMarket
maker fro the previous hardware to the new one.
Figuring out the best way to make the maker a SystemD service would be
the next step.</p>
<p>A foolishness is that I did not enable <code>txindex</code> from
the start,
and even after having to reindex, did not think to enable
<code>txindex</code> before reindexing.
So I may be forced to reindex once again, sigh, and that seems to
be slow on this new hardware (and probably would be slow anywhere
as well).</p>
<p>I also intend to set up a C-Lightning node (again behind a Tor
hidden service) here on this new hardware.
Probably I will set up two, one a throwaway that will then provide
my donation address(es), so that I can use my
<a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-October/002245.html'>CoinSwapper</a>
idea to clean incoming donations.
I have already compiled C-Lightning 8.0.0 from the official source
tarball and installed it, though have not run it with anything
more complex than <code>--help</code> or <code>--version</code>.</p>
<p>In other news my JoinMarket maker was able to earn a tiny amount
of funds since the previous weekly log.
Hopefully on its new home in the new hardware it will work harder!</p>
<p>Finally, my ISP, for some reason, gave a router to connect to the
Internet, that is apparently incapable of manually setting port
forwardings, at all, I checked the user manuals available on the
Internet and none of them match the exact model given to me
(all of them show some way to set up port forwardings, but does
not match the UI this particular model shows).
Fortunately Tor Fixes This, Tor NAT punching FTW, still I
specifically requested the ISP to provide a stable public IP so that
I can support the Tor network as a relay or bridge as well, sigh.
Without a way to forward ports the stable public IP is pointless.
I have filed a support ticket to the ISP, hopefully they can resolve
this without me having to go buy a better router than this
<span title='proof-of-stake'>PoS</span><!-- PoS is a PoS -->
they installed.</p>

<h2>defiads</h2>
<p>I have some activity in the
<a href='https://github.com/defiads/defiads'>defiads/defiads</a>
recently.
Granted, this is mostly me just adding some documents detailing
some of the thoughts behind the current defiads design, and not
any coding or even just defiads design work.
Sadly I was planning these documentations already late last
year, and was not able to complete them until recently,
to my regret.</p>
<p>To be clear, I and Steven Roose are the current admins of
the defiads repository, so I and/or Steven will continue to
maintain defiads and hopefully drive its continued development.
The repository and its organization remain owned by Tamas,
but our admin rights to the repository should be sufficient
for the foreseeable future.
Philbert Wallace is probably the main coder working on defiads
as of now.
Both Philbert and I are new to Rust, so it will take a good
amount of poking through the code before we actually do
something substantial with it.</p>

<h2>Privacy on Lightning</h2>
<p><a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-January/002431.html'>Yet
another lengthy spam post.</a></p>
<p>One of the insights here is that basically, increasing the
number of interediate nodes is not necessarily a straight
improvement in privacy.
This is a surprising result.
Our intuition when considering onchain mixing is that the
larger the number of participants in the mix,
the greater your privacy.</p>
<p>For instance, consider a simplified model where you, as a
taker, perform a 2-participant CoinJoin with a maker.
To improve your privacy, you could make multiple such
CoinJoins with different makers.
Suppose all <em>except</em> one of the makers are just
sockpuppets of a surveillance company.
That single &ldquo;honest&rdquo; maker means that
afterwards, the surveillor has only a 50% chance of
guessing whether you own the final UTXO of that sequence
of CoinJoins or not.
While not ideal, this is an entire bit of entropy relative
to the situation where <em>all</em> the makers you chose
were sockpuppets of the same surveillor.
From this, we might get the intuition that more participants
in a mix is better.</p>
<p>For the Lightning Network, this does not apply quite as
cleanly.
Suppose you have this network:</p>
<p><pre>
               D
               |
               |
A -- S1-- S2-- B -- E
            \  |
             \ |
              S3 -- C
</pre></p>
<p>Let us assume that <code>S1</code>, <code>S2</code>,
and <code>S3</code> are nodes owned by a single surveillor.
So the path <code>A -&gt; S1 -&gt; S2 -&gt; S3 -&gt; C</code>
is congruent to doing a sequence of 2-participant CoinJoins
with 3 makers that are sockpuppets of the same surveillor,
i.e. you get no privacy from the surveillor.</p>
<p>Now you might be tempted to lengthen the path artificially,
taking the path
<code>A -&gt; S1 -&gt; S2 -&gt; B -&gt; S3 -&gt; C</code>.
But this is not quite the same as you making a sequence of
2-participant CoinJoins, with 4 makers, 3 of which are
sockpuppets of the same surveillor!</p>
<p><ul>
<li>In the onchain case you can wait for a random number of
blocks between CoinJoins.
In the Lightning case, every forwarding node is strongly
incentivized to do forwards quickly, so the sidereal time
at which a payment leaves <code>S2</code> and enters
<code>S3</code> is a strong indicator that this is a
semantically-single payment.</li>
<li>Without path decorrelation all the forwards have the
same hash.
The addition of <code>B</code> here is <em>utterly
pointless</em>, as the surveillor knows for certain that
the exact single payment here is being considered.
Even <em>with</em> path decorrelation,
where you could argue that in fact what happened is
the payment actually went to <code>E</code>
while <em>completely by coincidence</em> a payment from
<code>D</code>,
of a very similar value,
at nearly the same time,
and with suspiciously-correlated timelock,
goes through <code>B</code> and into <code>S3</code>,
but the surveillor will still bet against that unlikely
possibility and consider this to be the same payment
as well.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Which illustrates the point: current Lightning still
leaks a good amount of information (though still far less
than non-privacy-conscious onchain use).
In particular, the value, sidereal timing, and timelock
are information we cannot feasibly remove
without sacrificing security (value, timelock) or
useability (sidereal timing).</p>
<p>Indeed, I can point out my
<a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-October/002245.html'>CoinSwapper</a>
idea.
It breaks value, sidereal timing, and timelock
correlation, by splitting the payment into
two stages:
first you make a payment from a throwaway node,
later you make a payment outwards from your
normal node, taking care to break value by
splitting it differently from the throwaway
payer, and taking care to break sidereal timing
by waiting for a while before transferring
outwards.</p>
<p>Perhaps even weirder proposals are possible,
such as asking forwarding nodes to deliberately
postpone forwarding (but why would they comply,
when they could earn earlier (assuming they
discount future coins, as is sensible for every
entity that cannot possibly live infinitely)
by forwarding right now?).
Having standard payment amounts helps break value
but there will always remain some tiny remainder
that you either round up to the lowest standard
payment amount and overpay to the payee, or
lose privacy with.
At least with timelocks we can use extended
shadow routing, though there are still bounds
that a surveillor can compute around.</p>

<h2>Advice</h2>
<p>Fewer people asked for advice regarding Bitcoin
from me in this week than in the previous week.
Topics include, but are not necessarily limited to,
coin swapping technology and non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies.
Nearly all my time that is not visible on mailinglist or
github was spent on the new hardware, and it seems likely
in the succeeding weeks that further setting up on the
new hardware will be my main activities.</p>
