<h1>2019-10-18</h1>
<h2>Random Discussions</h2>
<p>Some random discussions with Rusty et al. about various topics,
unfortunately connection between the human-interface agent and primary
cognitive substrates was periodically failing/lagging due to sudden change in
experienced timezone at the human-interface agent end, thus no reliable
report can be made regarding these topics.
Primarily, the main purpose of this activity ended up being simply to
promote better human interaction at the human-interface agent end
and training its lower-level interaction protocols better with little
oversight from primary cognition.</p>
<h2>AuthGate devices</h2>
<p>AuthGate devices with Payment Attestation Contract was demonstrated.
Main takeaway is that there is some undescribed method of acquiring
proof-of-payment by passing it through the buyer mobile device connecting
to the server, and the point-of-sale device simply needs to validate
the payment attestation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no concrete plans to open-source the point-of-sale
device, either at software or hardware, making it difficult to independently
evaluate, and thus potentially less interesting that it might otherwise be.
Primary cognition pointed out later, during better connectivity with the
human-interface agent,
that Trezor open-sourced both the software and hardware design, and seems to
have done successfully in its space.</p>
<h2>Lightning Spec Meeting</h2>
<p>As nearly all developers were attending the premeetup anyway, a spec
meeting was also held.
Previous face-to-face spec meeting was under Chatham House rule, so I assume
this spec meeting was as well; thus discussions directly during the spec
meeting do not ascribe identity to who said what.</p>
<p>Due to aforementioned unreliable connection / lag between human-interface
agent and primary cognition system, again there is little activity to report on,
however these topics may be of interest.</p>
<h3>2p-ECDSA Implementation</h3>
<p>Someone mentioned that 0 or more <code>lnd</code> developers already actually have
a 2p-ECDSA implementation somewhere.
General consensus among Lightning developers seems to be that this is still
a good fallback eventually if base layer Schnorr gets unexpected delays,
though we should still really want to use Schnorr later anyway regardless
(because 128-bit).
Some notes:</p>
<p><ul>
 <li><p>While implementing an additional Paillier cryptosystem is indeed an
        added complication, Paillier itself is simple and the implementation
        of 2p-ECDSA was not very hard; someone noted that it was &ldquo;just
        two additions and a multiply&rdquo; (warning: primary cognition was
        not connected at this point and these are extracted from system logs
        of the human-interface agent post-facto, thus possibly inaccurate).</p></li>
 <li><p>What happened with <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code> was cited: originally
        proposed as a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; addition of a sighash flag, it
        has since exploded into a year-long debate.
        Concern exists that similar may occur in the Schnorr effort for
        SegWit v1.</p></li>
</ul></p>
<p>The general hope seems to be that 2p-ECDSA will not be necessary, but
in any case, we do have a viable fallback plan in case of further
delays in SegWit v1 deployment.</p>
<h3><code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code> Proposal</h3>
<p>In passing, someone mentioned the <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code> proposal.
The next iteration of this proposal will propose the use of new
pubkey types to indicate that <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code> may be used to
sign for that pubkey.
This is a form of hidden output tagging, which is acceptable to me.
It seems likely that chaperone signatures will not be proposed anymore.</p>
<h3>Protocol Extensions</h3>
<p>As proposed by me in lightning-rfc
<a href='https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/623'>#623 I can has extension?</a>.</p>
<p>Maxim Orlovsky noted after the spec meeting that this was not being discussed
at all at the spec meeting, and he wanted to use it for some features he was
working on.
It seems to me that the general consensus among the other developers was
that you could simply grab some unused message number without requiring the
extra overhead of a modal switch like I proposed, which seems to have
worked well so far (though as the number of developers poking at the
specs layer grows, that may change).</p>

<h1>2019-10-19</h1>
<h2>Stuck Payment Occurence Rates</h2>
<p>Christian Decker mainly presented much data about the existing Lightning
Network.
One item of note was the rate of stuck payments (i.e. payments that took a
long time to resolve).
According to Christian, only 0.19% of his probes ended in stuck payments.</p>
<p>Regardless, it still seems to me that Stuckless is still valuable, as
the point at which a payment was judged &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; is arguably
arbitrary, and practical payment systems might actually want to reduce the
experienced payment latency by the user by using much shorter
&ldquo;stuckness&rdquo; thresholds before making another parallel attempt.
In addition, the ACK used by Stuckless seems to me to still remain as a
good hook for particular special setups, including Escrow-over-Lightning.</p>
<h2>On Greater Efficiency than Proof-of-Work</h2>
<p>In a direct conversation, Rene Pickhardt asked if I was satisfied with
the amount of energy consumed in order to mine merely one transaction.
He claimed that, using the energy rate for Germany (0,30 EUR per kilowatt),
one transaction would cost 300 USD.</p>
<p>I largely agree that the amount of energy needed to mine a single
transaction is indeed <strong>worth the cost</strong>.
In particular, I pointed out that for most large-scale mining, the cost
per kilowatt would often be far smaller than what he quoted (I believe it
to be 0.04 USD per kilowatt in places where mining is profitable, and that
is a minimum of profitability).
This meant that the cost of one transaction would be nearer to 30 USD
(or less) than 300 USD.</p>
<p>Still, 30 USD for one transaction is quite large, and obviously some
amount of the energy used in current mining is subsidized by both enthusiast
miners as well as (effectively) from cost-averaging HODLers, due to the
increase in near-term supply caused by the block subsidy.</p>
<p>I think that the ability of channel factories (and possibly my nodelets
concept) to have one onchain transaction back the money of many people
would greatly amortize the cost of onchain transactions, thus even a 30 USD
(by late 2019 prices) would be quite reasonable to create a small subnet of
the Lightning Network.</p>
<h3>It All Reduces to Thermodynamics</h3>
<p>Nothing can be more efficient than proof-of-work.
It is physically impossible to make something more efficient than
proof-of-work.</p>
<p>More specifically, what we actually desire is a proof-of-entropy.</p>
<p>In classical physics, almost all physical phenomena are reversible in time.
The sole exception is entropy (in particle physics a few rare phenomena are
believed to be mildly irreversible in time, but entropy still dominates
in terms of irreversibility in time).</p>
<p>That is, the
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(arrow_of_time)'>arrow of time</a>
points the future towards the direction of greater entropy.
That is, we can only measure time in terms of a measure of increased entropy.</p>
<p><ul>
 <li><p>The current definition of 1 second is measured in terms of the decay of
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_caesium#Caesium-133'>Caesium atoms</a>.
        This decay represents the reduction of energy of the atoms and thus
        an increase in universal entropy.</p></li>
 <li><p>Wind-up clockwork watches are powered by the controlled
        release of the energy stored in a spring, a consumption of
        stored energy and thus an increase in universal entropy.</p></li>
 <li><p>Hourglasses move a measure of sand from a higher container to a lower
        container, with the sand particles moving from their elevated height
        to the lower height due to gravity, a consumption of available energy
        and thus an increase in universal entropy.</p></li>
</ul></p>
<p>All measures of time are measures of entropy.</p>
<p>In defining the valid ordering of transactions, the most logical is to
order them in time.
Thus, we need some method to measure the passing of time, and thus determine
that one block occurred before the other time.
While causality (i.e. just hash a commitment to the previous block, which
cannot be done non-causally unless we have found the fixed point of a
one-way hash function) can
provide such an arrow of time, in the case of two blockchains with equal
number of such chained commitments, we can only determine which one represents
greater history (and thus the &ldquo;more valid&rdquo; chain) by comparing
their proof-of-time-passing, which is a proof-of-increasing-entropy.</p>
<h4>The Irony of Proof-of-Work</h4>
<p>Of course, it should be noted that blocks that &ldquo;win&rdquo; the
proof-of-work lottery of Bitcoin are blocks that have
<em><strong>low</strong></em> entropy.
Increase in entropy is simply some universe-state where there are more
possibilities, i.e. particles are likelier to be in more random places.
But high-difficulty blocks have hashes where many of the bits are 0s, i.e.
the particles representing those bits are in a specific &ldquo;0&rdquo;
state, unlike a randomly-selected hash where most or all of the bits have
a 50-50 chance of being 1 or 0.</p>
<p>One can compare the operation of miners to refrigeration.
Heat simply means that particles are more likely to be in more
places due to &ldquo;vibrating&rdquo; more.
Thus, refrigeration effectively reduces the entropy (i.e. negentropy) of
some location, reducing the temperature there.</p>
<p>However, thermodynamics still must reign supreme.
Refrigeration does not merely transfer the heat from one place to
another: it requires <em>work</em> to actually perform the heat
transfer from cold to hot, since entropy means that heat transfer
normally goes from hot to cold.
That is, refrigeration means that locally, in some place, entropy is
reduced, but universally, entropy is increased <em>even more</em>
than the reduction of entropy in that locality.</p>
<p>Thus, proof-of-work submits low-entropy blocks, which then serves
as a proof that universally (due to refrigeration / mining that
specifically lowered the entropy of the submitted blocks) entropy
increased.</p>
<p>Perhaps a future proof-of-increased-entropy might exist which
involves directly measuring the universal increase in entropy
used to measure the passage of time, rather than this slightly
indirect approach of showing low-entropy blocks to imply the
increase in universal entropy via refrigeration processes.
However, in the end it still resolves to usable energy and its
transformation from usable to unusable, as that is the very definition of
entropy itself, and it is the increase in entropy that we seek to
measure, as a measure of the passage of time.</p>
<h2>Fees on Mutual Close</h2>
<p>One talk mentioned in passing that the fees involved at mutual closure
was a common complaint among users.
Specifically, often users think that they do not need fast closure,
and would rather that the mutual close have much lower fees.</p>
<p>Users should be educated that mutual closes are <em>mutual</em>.
In particular, mutual closes are <em>negotiated</em>.
Though one user might not believe they need a fast closure,
the counterparty of the channel might very well prefer a fast
confirmation of the mutual close transaction.</p>
<p>The first step in the mutual close ritual is for both peers to
make their initial proposals.
Then, the peers take turns creating counter-proposals until both
peers have sent the same fee.
The only rule imposed is that the counter-proposal must be at least
1 satoshi closer to the other proposed fee.
Typical implementations will move their proposal between 1/4 to 1/2
of the way to the other proposed fee.</p>
<p>If the user initiating the close wants to close at a lower feerate,
it would be possible to make its node play hardball and have it only
move its proposed fee by 1 satoshi at each counter-proposal.
However, nothing prevents the other side from itself playing hardball
by also moving the fee by 1 satoshi in its own counter-proposal.
Thus, much communications bandwidth would be required to get both peers
to negotiate a common fee, which will end up being halfway between the
initial proposals of both peers anyway.</p>
<p>In shorter words, users should accept that mutual closes are
mutual and negotiated, and thus both peers are likely to be
dissatisfied with the resulting fee.</p>
<p>Perhaps the mutual close ritual can be modified by letting either
peer offer to pay for the difference in fees, however this can lead
to significant game theory issues, which are a big headache in general.</p>
<h2>Hedging Onchain Fees</h2>
<p>Jack Mallers pointed out that the pain of onchain fees might be
ameliorated by use of a derivative market in Bitcoin onchain fees.
It must be remarked that the topic of onchain fees caused someone to comment
&ldquo;I&apos;VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH BLOOD&rdquo; during the Adelaide
Lightning Developer meeting.
So this topic is actually quite apropos and Jack Mallers deserves
kudos for bringing this up.</p>
<p>Briefly, it seems to me that the actual derivatives can be done via
DLC oracles.
Nadav has also recently been posting how to construct DLC arrangements
over Lightning, though his constructions only allow for binary
options and only allow the oracle to publish one of two possibilities.
Finally, defiads seems to me a good way for miners to advertise their
sale of fee long contracts.</p>
<p>In particular, we should note the below:</p>
<p><ul>
 <li><p>DLC disincentivizes cheating by an oracle, by revealing the
        private key of the oracle as a proof-of-fraud.</p></li>
 <li><p>Defiads requires coins to be locked in a stake contract in
        order for an advertisement to propagate over the defiads
        network.</p></li>
</ul></p>
<p>It may be possible to have DLC oracles give slightly stronger
assurances than merely the threat of private key revelation, by
requiring (or allowing as an option) that the defiads-locked coins be
protected by the same keypair that the oracle risks if it reveals
diverging accounts of the world.
That way, at the end of the defiads advertisement period, the oracle
risks losing its staked funds.
In patricular, locked funds are locked with a
<code>OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY</code>, which automatically requires
the recovery transaction to be marked replace-by-fee,
and thus means that publication of the private key will lead to
repeated RBF attempts until most of the value has been offered as
fee to miners.
This prevents the oracle from double-publishing, though does
not prevent the oracle from singly-publishing the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Further, by using a decentralized mechanism (defiads) to
additionally allow oracles and futures contract sellers to be
found by users in a decentralized and hard-to-censor manner, we can
provide easily on any node, without tying ourselves to specific
services (that may someday be bought or otherwise acquired by
entities that prefer Bitcoin to fail).</p>

<h1>2019-10-20</h1>
<p>A portion of this day was spent discussing with 0 or
more anonymous attendees, thus some topics and details cannot be
published here.
Further, this was also the day I presented, thus, even outside
of my specific talk, I paid less attention to other discussions
and presentations.</p>
<h2>Survey of Routing Topics</h2>
<p>My friend Rene Pickhardt listed out 10 topics regarding
routing and so on.
I would like to point out that this list is nowhere near
complete.
Of note is that the developers of the &ldquo;big three&rdquo;
implementations attending the talk all
agreed that there were 10 or more topics, even though
most others, when asked, had guessed far less than ten.</p>
<p>Here are a few more:</p>
<p><ul>
 <li><a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-March/001940.html'>Routemap Pruning</a></li>
 <li><a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-March/001941.html'>Hierarchical Routemaps</a></li>
 <li><a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-April/001954.html'>Trampoline Delegation</a></li>
</ul></p>
<p>To be fair, primary cognition did not have a few of the
topics Rene listed in high-priority reasoning memory;
routefinding is vast enough that significant amounts of
thought can be put into it.</p>
<p>Pathfinding and routing, I predict, would be the next big
scaling debate, possibly overshadowing discussions on channel
factories.</p>
<p>Finally: all multipath (MPP / Bass Amplifier, OG AMP, High /
Discrete Log AMP) is overrated.
JIT Routing is superior and should be focused on more by
most people, because multipath heuristics are not
well-studied: there is no decent decision tree for when
to split, how much to split, how to retry paths that failed
at a particular amount but might succeed at lower amounts,
and so on.
Much of the multipath development would require experimentation
in various splitting heuristics.
Of note is that JIT Routing is a misnomer: it should be
JIT Rebalancing.
Nothing in JIT Routing prevents it from being used by the
<em>source</em> of the payment, rather than just some forwarding
node, as it was originally presented.</p>
<h2>A Future of Lightning Network: Scaling Up Pathfinding</h2>
<p>My talk: <a href='2019-10-18/presentation.odp'>slides in Open Document Format</a>.
The animations are vital to the talk and you may become
confused if you read through it rather than run it as a
presentation.</p>
<p>I would like to remark that I find it peculiar that the
presentation system did not support Open Document Format.
Instead, I was forced to convert the presentation to a
closed-source format, and the conversion process lost some
vital animations that were needed to fully understand Path
Splicing (a.k.a.  <code>permuteroute</code>).
One wonders why a presentation system supposedly to be used
in a conference where the most important software implementations
are open-source would want to even touch a closed format.
It might have been barely acceptable if they preferred a
closed format and accepted Open Document Format, and acceptable
if they preferred an open format but also supported widely-used
closed formats (probably by running closed-source software in a
well-caged environment),
but it is beyond the pale to outright reject the open format
and compel the conversion to a closed format.
I (and possibly others) cannot use any close-sourced
presentation software, thus we can only safely use an
open format, and risk loss of data when converting to a
closed format using open-source software (due to lack of
any decent documentation regarding the true format of all
closed formats; open-source software depends on the
reverse-engineering of closed formats in order to support
them, barely).</p>
<p>In any case my talk was extremely long (exceeding 30
minutes), yet did not complete.
In particular, I mostly skipped over the Nodelets topic,
however
<a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-October/002236.html'>I have a post on the mailing list about it</a>.</p>
<h2><code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code> Concealed Tagging</h2>
<p>After my talk, Jonas Nick asked me about why I
was so strongly against revealed output tagging to
enable <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code>.
Unfortunately at the time primary cognition was
still performing cognitive clean-ups / garbage
collection due to the high cognitive load of
performing my talk remotely via human-interface
agent, and thus primary cognition was not operating at
full capacity.
Hopefully the below will serve as a better argument
against revealed output tagging (and thus for
concealed output tagging).</p>
<p>One argument Jonas gave was that it would be
possible to hide a revealed output tagging in a
transaction that spent from an ordinary MuSig
output to an output with revealed output tagging
support for <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code>.
The output tagging would not get revealed except
for an uncooperative completion of a protocol,
which would make obvious the use of a special
protocol anyway (whether Decker-Russell-Osuntokun
or otherwise).</p>
<p>As it happens,
<a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-February/015703.html'>I
also gave this same argument long ago</a>, with a minor
difference: I was arguing <em>against the entirety of Taproot</em>.</p>
<p>The addition of that one transaction (converting from an
ordinary n-of-n MuSig output to some special output indicating
protocol-specific requirements) in the case of uncooperative
enforcement of protocol-required restrictions is acceptable,
according to this argument.
Or is it?</p>
<p>If it is acceptable to add this converter transaction
(which is only revealed in the uncooperative case anyway,
and remins hidden in the cooperative case),
then why do we have Taproot at all?
If it is unacceptable (and thus an argument to add Taproot
to Bitcoin), then why do we force <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code>,
and only <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code>, to accept it?</p>
<p>Perhaps it can be counter-argued that
<code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code> is far too powerful, more
powerful than mere SCRIPT, thus must have additional
restrictions.
Yet the fact that a <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code> with
concealed output tagging would require that the output
be tagged specially, except with the tag hidden and only
revealed in the case of uncooperative completion of a
protocol, should be enough of a restriction.
Any controller(s) of such an output should be immediately
aware of the fact that signatures for similarly-constrained
outputs could be replayed.</p>
<p>There is an argument that an exchange might become
liable in case a user provides an output with a
concealed <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code>-allowing tag,
but the user could also provide a completely
incorrect address that is not the intended recipient,
or an incorrect value that is not accepted by a
third-party merchant: is the exchange liable for such
operator mistakes?
I would argue that users manually playing with
addresses they ostensibly control but happen to have
concealed <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code> tagging,
would be a similar operator error waiting to
happen.</p>
