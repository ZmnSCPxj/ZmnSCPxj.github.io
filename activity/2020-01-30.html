<h2>Server</h2>
<p>A good part of my time was spent further tinkering with my brand new
server hardware.</p>
<p>One issue that came up was when I made my JoinMarket Maker into a
SystemD Service.
Obviously I set it to <code>After=bitcoind.service</code> so that it
will start after Bitcoin Core was loaded.
Unfortunately, the
<a href='https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/638239de7502eed57f3b800d9b488de85f00d391/contrib/init/bitcoind.service'>bitcoind.service
file</a> in the bitcoin/bitcoin <code>contrib/init/</code> directory
does <em>not</em> wait for Bitcoin to start up completely.</p>
<p>It turns out that Bitcoin has to re-read the block indexes when it
starts up, and it can take up to ~7 seconds to do so.
During this time, it will refuse to serve any RPCs.
However, the launching process exits as soon as possible, meaning
SystemD thinks that Bitcoin is already perfectly fine immediately,
then starts any dependencies on Bitcoin.
The JoinMarket Maker, being such a dependency, is then started up
very quickly after, but fails to start because it wants to ask
Bitcoin some RPCs but Bitcoin is not yet ready to serve those.</p>
<p>What I did was write a simple script that just loops until a
<code>bitcoin-cli</code> command succeeds, as below, and add it
to <code>ExecStartPost</code>.</p>
<pre>
#! /bin/sh

while ! bitcoin-cli "$@" getblockcount &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
do
sleep 1
done
</pre>
<p>Note the <code>"$@"</code>.
SystemD invocations are not &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and you should
copy the <code>-datadir</code> and <code>-conf</code> arguments
you pass into <code>bitcoind</code> to the above script.
The above script then forwards it to <code>bitcoin-cli</code>
via <code>"$@"</code>.
You need <code>-datadir</code> since <code>bitcoin-cli</code>
wants to set up a datadir if you do not have one, and the
<code>bitcoind.service</code> in the bitcoin/bitcoin repository
makes the home directory read-only.
And of course the above script should be made executable as well.</p>
<p>Obviously this delays startup and you might not want it for
your &ldquo;normal&rdquo; computer that you regularly shut down
and boot up every day, but for an always-on server that has to
survive power interruptions and automated updates, the additional
delay to wait for proper startup of other services dependent on
Bitcoin is worth it.</p>
<p>In C-Lightning, we avoid this.
Daemonization requires that a process fork twice, with the parent
and its direct child exiting, and the grandchild process being
the daemon that lives on.
However, on C-Lightning, before the fork we establish a pipe
from the parent to the grandchild process.
The grandchild does some initializations and database loading,
then establishes the RPC and then closes the pipe.
Once the pipe is closed, only then does the parent actually
exit.
This technique fits better with SystemD, as it assumes the
exit of the parent means the daemon is now working properly.</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>I had a good amount of activity and pull requests on
<a href='https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning'>ElementsProject/lightninh</a>
and
<a href='https://github.com/defiads/defiads'>defiads/defiads</a>.
Well for defiads mostly just me reviewing and commenting and merging.</p>
<p>For C-Lightning, mostly a few clarifications, and some minor modifications
and improvements, including the ability to now set permissions on the
C-Lightning RPC file, and to immediately finish <code>waitanyinvoice</code>
if no unprocessed invoice is currently available.
I am still working on <code>multifundchannel</code>, but for now I
will make <code>connect</code> have the ability to connect to multiple
nodes at once, to test out my
<a href='https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/3401'>sparks</a>
implementation.
Later I will add <code>multifundchannel_start</code> and
<code>multifundchannel_complete</code> and
<code>multifundchannel_cancel</code>, I suppose.</p>

<h2>Advice</h2>
<p>Only a small amount of people asking about advice this week.</p>

<h2>Tor Browser</h2>
<p>I am slowly transitioning to using Tor Browser almost exclusively,
when emulating a human operating a standard computer.
Previous hardware (and maybe its LTS OS?) and ISP gave bad experience when
doing anything in Tor Browser, it seems with my current ISP and hardware
(OS?) Tor is almost as smooth as a commodity "home" ISP common
in the places I have infested.</p>
<p>Some websites, however, keep thinking of my Tor Browser as a new device
and keep asking for multi-factor authentication.
GitHub is one of these.</p>
<p>This is particularly daft since I can <code>torify git push</code> to
GitHub <em>without</em> being pestered about multi-factor authentication.
And the worst thing you can do to a GitHub repository is to <em>push bad
code into it</em> and wait for victims to pull and execute your code.
So the multi-factor authentication pestering is just not that useful
against protecting GitHub repositories,
and is just an annoyance at this point.</p>
<p>Google applications are another set of pesterers.
I should probably avoid Google applications, but GitHub is not really
something I can feasibly avoid.</p>

<h2>Zenon</h2>
<p>With the help of Grounded Speculator, I found out that an entity
called Zenon Networks is trying to somehow connect itself to
Square Crypto via the coincidental similarity of &ldquo;ZNN&rdquo;
to &ldquo;Zmn&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You might want to see the
<a href='https://medium.com/@groundedspeculator/zmnscpxj-weighs-in-on-zenon-network-aa0963f107d4'>medium
article that Grounded Speculator wrote</a>.
The screenshots of emails are authentic.</p>
<p>Briefly: I am not associated with Zenon network, I have not
developed code for Zenon network, I no longer think sidechains
are useful (they are not at all useful for scaling, and additional
features to mainchain, while desirable, are <em>not</em> necessary
for the survival and continued usefulness of Bitcoin: offchain
transactions, which just require n-of-n, are all you need in
the future, and even a good number of features can be done with
e.g. <a href='../bitcoin/unchained.html'>Smart Contracts Unchained</a>,
which is largely an <em>offchain</em> proposal, not a sidechain one).
I am a coder, I write code, you can check my
<a href='https://github.com/ZmnSCPxj'>publicly-available
code</a> and see my coding style and compare it
to the code of Zenon network (if you can <em>find</em> any).</p>
