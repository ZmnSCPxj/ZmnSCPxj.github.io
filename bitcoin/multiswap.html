<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><a href='https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/multiparty-s6/'>S6</a>
is a multiparticipant CoinSwap.
Unfortunately, as described,
it cannot achieve maximal privacy for the number of swaps involved.
This is because all participants must first agree on a single
permutation of participants.
If a blockchain analyst notices the CoinSwap,
then it need consider only &ldquo;circular&rdquo; permutations,
i.e. (N - 1)!.</p>

<h1>Pointless Digression</h1>
<p>During World War II, Germany made use of the
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine'>Enigma Machine</a>.
At the time, the Enigma was novel cryptography,
and we all know the Zeroth Commandment of Cryptography:
<strong><em>Thou Shalt Not Roll Thy Own Crypto</em></strong>.</p>
<p>A major flaw of Enigma was that
<em>no letter could ever encode to itself</em>.
This was because of a component known as the reflector, which made
Enigma a self-reciprocal encryption and reduced the physical size of
the machine.</p>
<p>Codebreakers were able to exploit this flaw to make further analysis
of the rest of the Enigma machine.
What they did was to put a possible plaintext
side-by-side with a known ciphertext.
If any letter in the plaintext matched in the same location with the
ciphertext, then they knew that the plaintext did not correspond to that
particular ciphertext &mdash;
<em>no letter could ever encode to itself</em>,
so if a possible plaintext had even one letter that matched with the
ciphertext letter, then that was not the plaintext behind the ciphertext.</p>
<p>What was generally done was that typical pieces of plaintext, such as
&ldquo;Keine besonderen Ereignesse&rdquo; (&ldquo;nothing to report&rdquo;),
&ldquo;ANX&rdquo;
(&ldquo;to&rdquo; i.e. to indicate the recipient of an order,
with &ldquo;X&rdquo; used to replace spaces / punctuation), or
&ldquo;FORT&rdquo;
(short for &ldquo;fortsetzung&rdquo; or &ldquo;continuation&rdquo;,
then followed by a timestamp indicating the time of the previous message
that this message was a continuation of)
would try to be matched on various locations in the ciphertext
(i.e. a known-plaintext attack to start the cryptanalysis).
Names and locations already known to be of interest to Germany,
as well as typical German military jargon, could also be tried.
If none of the letters matched, the chances were good that it would be
the plaintext behind the ciphertext,
because <em>no letter could ever encode to itself</em>.</p>
<h2>The S6 Non-maximal Privacy</h2>
<p>S6, as mentioned, does not have maximal privacy.
This is because it only requires a circular permutation
of the participants.</p>
<p>More specifically, suppose we have 3 participants in S6, A, B, and C.
We would shuffle these participants.
Suppose we got the order C, A, B.
Then C would pay to A, A would pay to B, and B would pay to C.
Notice that this is a circle, and thus the number of permutations is
only (N - 1)! due to this really being a circular permutation.
In particular, onchain the order C, A, B would also be look the
same as the order B, C, A and A, B, C.</p>
<p>The core realization here is that
<em>no participant could ever pay to itself</em>.
This leads to the possibility of further analysis
of previous and subsequent behavior,
being simplified by taking this heuristic when a multiparticipant
CoinSwap is detected.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the need for staggered timeouts at each step,
such a circular payment is required by the S6 construction.
In particular, every multiparticipant CoinSwap that creates any kind
of &ldquo;route&rdquo; similar to Lightning Network would have the
same <em>no participant could ever pay to itself</em> weakness.
Thus, if blockchain analysis identifies a possible CoinSwap via other
heuristics, this heuristic can be used to reduce the privacy before
and after the mix.</p>
<p>(I am aware that things like multitransaction CoinSwap can make it
very hard to identify CoinSwap occurring on the blockchain in the first place,
but it seems to me safer to have multiple layers of obfuscation,
as the opportunity to do multitransaction
might not always be available;
practical limits on multitransaction
(who can afford to split their funds to a hundred UTXOs,
in particular the fees involved in spending those?)
can reduce the effort needed to crack the obfuscation.)</p>
<p>To be very clear, it is certainly a strength of CoinSwap that
it can be hidden among ordinary payments.
But it is also a property of CoinSwap that the cycle of payments have
to be around the same amount.
Thus, when analyzing multiple transactions, it would be possible to find
some number of transactions with similar payment amounts.
Even with multitransaction,
we can bound the number of transactions making up one payment
in the overall CoinSwap.</p>
<p>It is helpful to compare this to CoinJoin.
In CoinJoin, the inputs and outputs are shuffled separately, and we
get very good privacy: the ith input might not correspond to
the ith output, but it also <em>might</em>, and because of this,
we can say that the ith input is paying to the ith output and that
participant could be paying to itself.
(I am aware that CoinJoin typically will have multiple inputs and
multiple change outputs as well, but in the case where everyone has a UTXO
of the exact correct size, then the simple ith input and ith output case
would still avoid <em>no participant could ever pay to itself</em>
of the corresponding simple &ldquo;circular routed&rdquo; CoinSwap.)
Thus we can consider that the weakness of this CoinSwap is due to
having only one shuffle of all the participants,
whereas CoinJoin shuffles the participants as inputs separately fom
shuffling the participants as outputs.
An N-participant CoinJoin would have N! possible permutations,
while an N-participant CoinSwap would have (N - 1)! possible permutations.
CoinSwap takes up much more blockchain space as well.
With N=10 this means CoinJoin has an order-of-magnitude more possible
permutations than CoinSwap, thus has greater obfuscation.</p>
<p>Of course, identifying possible CoinJoin transactions onchain is
significantly easier than identifying possible CoinSwaps,
i.e. CoinSwap is (at least a little) steganographic.
But transactions of similar value (or, to handle the multitransaction case,
small groups of transactions of similar value) that are in nearby
blocks are probably multiparticipant CoinSwaps as well.
It would be nice if we could somehow create a non-circular
CoinSwap mechanism so that, even if a CoinSwap is successfully identified,
it would have N! possible permutations rather than (N - 1)!.</p>

<h1>Directionality</h1>
<h2>Time-based Directionality</h2>
<p>S6 requires &ldquo;staggered&rdquo; timeouts,
i.e. if the shuffled order is C, A, B,
then the B-&gt;C payment has a shorter timeout
than the A-&gt;B payment,
which has a shorter timeout
than the C-&gt;A payment.
Now, in the ideal case where the protocol completes,
timeouts are not published onchain,
so this should not be a problem, right?</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that the timeouts are
&ldquo;staggered&rdquo; means that
C has to claim its incoming payment before B and A does.
We can thus expect that the claim transaction done by C
will be broadcast to the Bitcoin network earlier
than the claim transaction transaction of B and A.
This can provide hints as to the shuffle order,
which a blockchain analyst can then use to identify
who ended up with which UTXO.</p>
<p>To protect against this, A, B, and C will have to set up
the entire S6 mechanism first, but instead of C claiming funds
onchain right after setup,
all of the participants have to create <code>nLockTime</code>-locked
transactions for each claim.
The <code>nLockTime</code> are randomized, from the current blockheight
to just before the shortest timeout.
Then C broadcasts the payment secret and enables all the claim
transactions to become valid.
The random <code>nLockTime</code> ensures that the transactions are
broadcast to the blockchain in some random order, preventing leakage
of the shuffle order.</p>
<p>Increasing the timeouts involved would help spread out the transactions
of the CoinSwap in time, at the cost of increasing the time that CoinSwap
takes.</p>
<h2>Value-based Directionality</h2>
<p>One of the obvious ways to set up a multiparticipant CoinSwap system
would be to emulate existing systems like JoinMarket and Lightning network.
That is, there are pre-existing entities that offer their liquidity in
exchange for fees (i.e. &ldquo;maker&rdquo;/&ldquo;forwarding node&rdquo;),
then later some entity takes the offered service
to perform mixing or payment
(i.e. &ldquo;taker&rdquo;/&ldquo;payer&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Since the makers are offering this as a service, they have to get paid
some fees for performing CoinSwaps.</p>
<p>The naive way to do so would be to emulate Lightning and give the
payment in the swap operations as well: if C is the taker, then the
C-&gt;A payment is of greater value than the the A-&gt;B payment
(the difference being the fee paid, as in Lightning),
and the A-&gt;B payment is greater than the B-&gt;C payment.</p>
<p>Of course, once the payments are identified as belonging to a single
CoinSwap, the differences in payment amount leak the shuffle order.
Obviously the output of the smallest payment
has the same history as the input of the largest payment
(remember, this is a circle of payments),
and that history is the history of the taker.</p>
<p>Worse, if the amount being mixed is a few orders of magnitude
larger than the fees involved
(a reasonable assumption, that we see in JoinMarket and Lightning),
then amount correlation can still help identify CoinSwaps
on the blockchain (small differences can be neglected at this stage),
then the differences in each sub-payment of the CoinSwap
can then be used in further analysis to reveal the shuffle order.</p>
<p>Regardless of shuffle order, the taker has to give out more money
than it receives,
and each maker gives out less money than what it receives.
By this knowledge, a blockchain analyst can determine the shuffle order
and who the taker is.
And once the blockchain analyst knows the shuffle order,
it knows who paid whom and thus can correlate the history of the
outputs with the inputs.</p>
<p>To protect against this, fees would have to be paid by other means.
If C is the taker, then it knows the payment secret.
Then it can set up Lightning payments to A and B for their fees,
with a final CLTV greater than the outgoing timeouts of A and B.
The payment secret onchain is then the same as the payment secret used
on-Lightning
(this is exactly what is used in Lightning Loop, Boltz,
and other onchain/offchain swap mechanisms).
Then the onchain payments will have the same amount,
preventing leaking of the shuffle order.</p>
<p>Alternately, if we do not want to ride on top of Lightning, we can
have C create conditional onchain payments to A and B as well that are
separate from the payment from CoinSwap C-&gt;A and A-&gt;B payments.
These extra payments are the fees paid
by the taker C to the makers A and B.</p>
<pre>
    Instead of (where C is the taker):

      C -amt+feeA+feeB-> A ---amt+feeB---> B
      ^                                    |
      |                                    |
      +-----------------amt----------------+

    Use:

      +----------------feeB----------------+
      |                                    |
      +-------feeA-------+                 |
      |                  |                 |
      |                  v                 v
      C ------amt------> A -----amt------> B
      ^                                    |
      |                                    |
      +-----------------amt----------------+
</pre>
<p>Of course, if the fees are small, then it might not be practical to have
those UTXOs onchain.
We could use a form of payjoin such that conditional payments are merged
as well from C funds to A and B funds
(briefly, the fee payment from C to B would spend UTXOs owned by C and B;
for example, if C owns 1 BTC and B owns 1 BTC, and the fee is agreed to be
0.001 BTC, then we first create a transaction spending the B and C funds
and outputting to a 2BTC output, then a claim transaction conditional on
the CoinSwap being completed which spends the 2BTC output and creates a
C-owned 0.999 BTC output and a B-owned 1.001 BTC output &mdash;
this can be construed as equivalent to dual-funding a Lightning channel
and then paying the fee over the channel, then closing the channel,
incidentally).
This prevents the creation of uneconomical dust UTXOs,
but it requires that C have some
other liquid funds that it cannot add to the mix,
allocated solely for paying fees.</p>
<p>Note that, in JoinMarket parlance, the mixdepth of the incoming fee
would have to be different from the mixdepth of the incoming CoinSwap
amount, else it would just as well leak who is the maker and who is the
taker as well.</p>
<p>Finally we can just wait for Bitcoin to have confidential transactions
so that amount correlation
and subsequent amount analysis is impossible.</p>

<h1>Breaking The Circle</h1>
<p>The cyclic nature of the payment is difficult since
leaking the shuffle order is sufficient to completely reveal
the entire CoinSwap.
The output shuffle order might be leaked by subsequent behavior,
which could mean an easier break of a CoinSwap round
compared to a CoinJoin round.</p>
<h2>Simultaneous Equal CoinSwap</h2>
<p>If we were able to magically shuffle who pays to whom,
then natural cycles would exist.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we shuffle four participants A, B, C, D.
We then shuffle them randomly to B, A, D, C.
Suppose instead of forming a cycle of payments
B-&gt;A, A-&gt;D, D-&gt;C, C-&gt;B,
we instead pair up the above shuffle (B, A, D, C)
with the unshuffled (A, B, C, D),
resulting in the sequence ((B, A), (A, B), (D, C), (C, D))
and create payments B-&gt;A, A-&gt;B, D-&gt;C, C-&gt;D.
By not making a single large cycle, we approach nearer to N!
rather than (N - 1)! possible permutations.</p>
<p>But we should also notice that this effectively creates
two cycles: A-&gt;B-&gt;A, and C-&gt;D-&gt;C.
Thus, one way to increase the obfuscation of CoinSwap
would be to run multiple CoinSwap cycles in parallel,
all of them with the same amount.
Some of these &ldquo;CoinSwaps&rdquo; could even be
just direct self-payments, therefore breaking
<em>no participant could ever pay to itself</em>.</p>
<p>Then, an independent blockchain analyst would not
be able to assume that all the payments occurring,
that happen to have equal values,
form a <em>single</em> large cycle;
or in other words, we are able to leave the (N - 1)!
circular permutations and instead approach N! permutations.</p>
<p><ol>
<li><p>In a JoinMarket-like system, a taker could
split the amount it wants mixed into multiple equal parts,
then trigger multiple multiparticipant CoinSwap cycles in parallel.
For example, instead of mixing an entire 1.0 BTC
in a single large CoinSwap round with 4 makers,
it can mix 0.5 BTC in a CoinSwap round with 3 makers and
another 0.5 BTC in a CoinSwap round with 1 maker.</p>
<p>Of course, care must be taken to ensure that
the taker redistributing the values of
its (likely non-equal) UTXOs
does not leave any evidence onchain.
If the taker has non-equal UTXOs,
then it should somehow be able to trade them for
equal-valued UTXOs without leaking this information onchain.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternately, any CoinSwap system could require
that all swaps have a specific value,
or that the swap value is from a limited set of allowed values.
This would greatly help prevent blockchain analysts
from differentiating various cycles.
This also simplifies self-swapping, as you just self-swap
one of the standard amounts and this helps not just yourself,
but everyone following the same standard sets of values.</p></li>
</ol></p>
<h2>Third-Party Enabler</h2>
<p>It would be best if we could truly shuffle who pays whom
without forming a large cycle of payments,
meaning there is the possibility of a self-payment.</p>
<p>We can do this by requiring an external party that does not
participate in the multiparticipant CoinSwap.
Instead, it generates the payment secret,
and once its fee is paid completely,
it releases the payment secret.
This is similar to the concept of
<a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-October/002214.html'>barrier escrow</a>
I and Nadav have proposed before.</p>
<p>The fee of this third-party barrier escrow is paid
by a single transaction constructed by all the participants.
What happens is that the CoinSwap transactions have equal value
<em>and equal timeout</em>.
Then the barrier escrow is offered the barrier escrow fee transaction,
with a shorter timeout.
Once the barrier escrow claims the escrow fee transaction,
it reveals the payment secret that allows
the other payments to be claimed.</p>
<p>This is not a perfect solution, however,
since the barrier escrow can collude with a participant
and provide the payment secret only to that participant,
which the participant can use just before the shared equal timeout,
hoping it can get its outgoing timeout branch
and its incoming payment secret branch.
This can be done trivially by sybilling an extra participant
in the CoinSwap.</p>
<p>In discussion with waxwing on the S6 blog comments,
a similar scheme where one of the participants has a shorter timeout
and all the others have the same, longer timeout, was also derived.
That scheme has a similar weakness as this scheme,
where the participant claiming a shorter timeout could collude
with another participant (or use a sybil).
In effect, that participant also doubles as this
third-party barrier escrow</p>
