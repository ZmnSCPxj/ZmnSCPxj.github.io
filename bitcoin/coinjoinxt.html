<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><a href='https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/coinjoinxt/'>CoinJoinXT</a>
is a privacy-enhancing technique
by which a group of participants
creates a subgraph of transactions
that pay out to each participant
what that participant put in.</p>
<p>In this writeup I present a Chaumian,
equal-valued CoinJoinXT.</p>
<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p><ul>
  <li><p>Equal-valued.
         Each participant commits an equal amount
         plus change,
         with better privacy assurances to the
         equal-valued outputs they own
         compared to their change outputs.</p></li>
  <li><p><a href='https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/the-steganographic-principle/'>Steganographic</a>.
         If analysts are unable to identify
         the CoinJoinXT,
         they will be actively misled
         about the interpretation of
         the transaction subgraph.</p></li>
  <li><p>Open Fungibility Fallback.
         Even if analysts <em>are</em> able to identify
         the CoinJoinXT,
         they will still be unable to
         link the equal-valued outputs
         to inputs,
         falling back to the same
         open fungibility as Chaumian CoinJoin.</p></li>
  <li><p>Requires Schnorr.
         Or at least some kind of
         aggregated multisig,
         which could become possible
         in ECDSA with some effort.</p></li>
  <li><p>Trustless.
         There is a central server, but it cannot
         steal funds.</p></li>
</ul></p>

<h1>Protocol</h1>
<p>As is usual for Chaumian mixes,
there exists a central server that operates
as a Chaumian bank.
Extra care is taken in this protocol
to ensure that input providers only release
their funds
if they can acquire the equivalent amount
as output of the mix.</p>
<p><ol>
<li><p>The central server declares the equal output value,
a time limit L as a future block height,
a confirmation depth D in blocks,
and a feerate it charges for the mix service.</p></li>
<li><p>Clients connect over Tor to the server and
check if they find the mix characteristics acceptable.</p></li>
<li><p>Client provides one or more <dfn>introductory transactions</dfn>,
which are signed but invalid transactions
that pay out to one output
with an invalid empty <code>scriptPubKey</code>.
These outputs will be filled with a SegWit address
derived later, and the total value must exceed
the equal output value.
All inputs of all introductory transactions must be SegWit.
The client also indicates a destination <code>scriptPubKey</code>
for its change output,
and a separate <code>scriptPubKey</code>
for its backout output.</p></li>
<li><p>Client provides a <dfn>mix session public key</dfn>,
together with a signature of an empty message using that public key,
to attest that it knows the private key.</p></li>
<li><p>Server waits until enough clients have registered their inputs.</p></li>
<li><p>Server may add one or more of its own inputs, which it can
merge together with fees it charges for the mix.</p></li>
<li><p>Server generates the <dfn>aggregate mix session public key</dfn>,
which is the multisignature public key aggregated from the individual
client mix session public keys.
Every output generated as intermediate output of the subgraph
must be derived trivially from the aggregate mix session public key,
but must be distinct from it to prevent information leakage.</p></li>
<li><p>Server generates output public keys for each introductory transaction.
It fills in the <code>scriptPubKey</code> of the introductory transaction
to the output public key,
creating the corresponding <dfn>entry transaction</dfn>.
It also generates the <dfn>backout transaction</dfn>,
which spends the entry transaction
and pays out to the indicated backout <code>scriptPubKey</code>
for that client,
and has an <code>nLockTime</code> of L.
The server generates these also for any of its own inputs that it
wishes to add to the mix to merge with the fees it extracts.</p></li>
<li><p>Server provides all the entry transactions and backout transactions
to all clients,
together with the tweak used for each entry transaction output.</p></li>
<li><p>Each client checks that all of its own introductory transactions
were included as an entry transaction,
and that the backout transactions spending those
entry transactions are valid and pay to their
chosen backout address.
Then each client gives its share of the signature
to all backout transactions,
and stores all the entry transaction outputs
as the <dfn>input UTXO set</dfn>.</p></li>
<li><p>Server combines all signatures to all backout transactions,
including any tweaks it added to blind the public key,
and then sends the signatures to the backout transaction of each client to that client.</p></li>
<li><p>Client verifies that the signature to their backout transaction
is valid,
then signs their entry transaction and broadcasts it
over the Bitcoin network, as well as giving a signed copy to the server.</p></li>
<li><p>Each client and server generates a blinded signature that the client
will later use to claim an output.</p></li>
<li><p>After a random time, each client connects over a new
Tor circuit to the server,
unblinding the signature and presenting it as proof that
the server should consider it a valid payee.
Client provides two <code>scriptPubKey</code> to be used as
output addresses, then disconnects this connection
(but retains its previous connection that it used for inputs).</p></li>
<li><p>Server generates the <dfn>proposed transaction graph</dfn>.
A later section of this writeup will propose methods of generating
this transaction graph.
A key element is that there exists a <dfn>keystone transaction</dfn>
that every other transaction in the graph must directly spend,
or spend a transaction that transitively spends a transaction that spends
directly from the keystone transaction.
The keystone transaction itself does not spend any other transaction
in the transaction graph.
Every output of a transaction that is spent by another transaction
(an <dfn>intermediate output</dfn>)
in the proposed transaction graph must be a tweak from
the aggregate mix session public key.
All transactions in the proposed transaction graph must have
<code>nLockTime</code> between the current block height,
and less than L.
Transactions must have equal or greater <code>nLockTime</code>
as transactions they spend, except for the keystone transaction
which has <code>nLockTime</code> equal to the current block height.
The server must also includes its own fee payout (merged with inputs it added)
as an output of the proposed transaction graph.</p></li>
<li><p>Server waits for all entry transactions to be confirmed with depth D.
If the time L becomes too near,
the server aborts the protocol and blames all entry transactions that have
not confirmed with depth D by that time, banning the transaction outputs
involving those entry transactions from future mix rounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Server provides the proposed transaction graph to each client,
together with the tweak on each intermediate output.</p></li>
<li><p>Client validates that the proposed transaction graph has a keystone
transaction,
that all non-keystone transactions spend directly or indirectly
from the keystone transaction,
that non-intermediate inputs spent belong to the input UTXO set,
and that non-intermediate outputs pay to their
indicated change and output addresses,
and that the payouts are correct, i.e. their change is correct
and the payouts to their output addresses sum up to the
equal value indicated.</p></li>
<li><p>Client provides its share of the signature for all non-keystone
transactions to the server.</p></li>
<li><p>Server aggregates the signatures for all non-keystone transactions,
applies the tweaks to each output spend,
and provides all non-keystone transaction signatures to all clients.</p></li>
<li><p>Client validates the signatures of the non-keystone transactions.
Then it provides its share of the signature for the keystone transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Server aggregates the signatures for the keystone transaction,
applies the tweaks to the inputs being spent,
provides the aggregated signatures for the keystone transaction to all clients,
and then broadcasts the keystone transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Clients and server wait until the entire transaction graph is
published onchain.</p></li>
</ol></p>
<p>Of note is that the above protocol inverts the use of backouts
and promise UTXOs compared to the original CoinJoinXT proposal.
The above protocol has backouts on each proposed input, rather
than on the proposed transaction graph that could be invalidated
by a proposed input.
This allows for easier scaling to more users and more complex graphs,
at the cost that each promised input has to be confirmed deeply
before signing the proposed transaction graph.
This will often lead to simple one-input one-output entry transactions,
which could be used as a way to expose a Chaumian CoinJoinXT.</p>

<h1>Generating the Proposed Transaction Graph</h1>
<p>Before creating the proposed transaction graph,
the server assigns some values to each client output addresses,
summing up to the equal value given to each client output.
The server can choose one output address to be equal to some
&ldquo;round&rdquo; number of some fiat amount,
or some &ldquo;round&rdquo; amount of bitcoins,
or equal to a change output to make it less clear to third parties
whether an output is change or part of an equal-valued output.
Once it has assigned values to each pair of output addresses,
it can break the pair and treat each output independently,
and also shuffle them with the change outputs it also has to pay out.</p>
<p>The simplest way to generate the proposed transaction graph
is to shuffle the inputs, shuffle the outputs,
then generate transactions by taking inputs until the topmost output
can be covered,
popping off the involved inputs and outputs,
and ensuring that succeeding transactions always spend the change output
of the previous transaction.
The first transaction in this sequence is then the keystone transaction.</p>
<p>The above simple strategy leads to a long straight chain of transactions,
which might be long enough that many transactions have to have the same
<code>nLockTime</code> in order to fit within the current blockheight
and the time limit L.
This long chain of transactions matches peel chains in blockchain analysis,
indicating that there is a single wallet that has received a number of inputs
and is now paying out apparently random-valued outputs.</p>
<p>It would be possible to randomly assign inputs and outputs to two
&ldquo;virtual&rdquo; wallets.
One of the wallets will have more total input value than output value,
so has to pay the difference to the other wallet;
this initial transaction is the keystone, so the change must be spent
by the paying virtual wallet while the received output of the payee
must be treated as the change that must be spent by the payee virtual
wallet.
Then two peel chains are generated.</p>
<p>The splitting strategy can be repeated to split the payouts
further to more virtual wallets,
taking care that each virtual wallet has a spendable input that
is directly or indirectly an output of the keystone.
Blockchain analysts will be able to identify these wallets as
separate clusters,
making it less likely that they will realize that it is really
an equal-sized CoinJoin.</p>
