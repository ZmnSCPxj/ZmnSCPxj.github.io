<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In <a href='https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/etBrzxdfNop3DqJvA/guardians-of-the-truth'>Guardians
of the Truth</a>,
Yudkowsky contrasts a <em>defensive</em> versus a <em>productive</em>
stance towards truth and knowledge.
Briefly, &ldquo;guardians&rdquo; of truth have nothing to
offer but their guardianship, and their resistance to new ideas
that might corrupt their precious truth.
Producers of truth, however, actively seek out, explore, and examine
strange new ideas, in the off-chance that they may find truth.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to consider these stances in relation to
Bitcoin.</p>

<h1>The Obsession with Original Satoshi</h1>
<p>A certain section of Bitcoin users treats the original
Bitcoin whitepaper with near-religious reverence.
This is an essentilly <em>defensive</em> stance towards
cryptocurrency, with such users viewing themselves as
&ldquo;guardians&rdquo; of &ldquo;Satoshi&apos;s Vision&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>One essential problem with such defensive stances
is that language is fluid.
The meaning of a word changes over time.
The words selected by Satoshi may have more than one meaning.
Though the letters of the whitepaper remain forever fixed,
interpretation of it changes over time.</p>
<p>Thus, such obssession often gets split into various camps
whose interpretation of &ldquo;the vision&rdquo;
gets mired into the diverging meanings of words,
as well as personalities
who have particularly strong expressions of their interpretation.</p>

<h1>The Obssession with Improving Over Satoshi</h1>
<p>Oppositely, another section of Bitcoin users treats
the Bitcoin whitepaper as a starting point.
Such users do not consider divergence from the original
Satoshi design to be some kind of heresy,
but instead consider this a necessity
for future improvements
that Satoshi was unable to foresee.</p>
<p>Though Satoshi was brilliant in his insight regarding Bitcoin,
in the end,
he possessed a sentience mechanism with finite resources.
More colloquially, &ldquo;Satoshi was merely human&rdquo;.
This is the driving thought behind this section of Bitcoin users.</p>
<p>In spite of leaving behind the letter of the whitepaper,
this <em>productive</em> position makes its followers
<em>converge</em> towards similar opinions of what direction
Bitcoin should take.</p>
<p>This is not due to some conspiracy or being paid by the
w^Hlizards of Blockstream.
Rather, it is a consequence of the fact that such a &ldquo;generative&rdquo;
stance uses as basis the physical laws of the Universe.
Here, metrics on usage, measurements of latency and bandwidth,
computations and logical processes valid across domains outside of cryptocurrency,
all dominate over the mere words of Satoshi.
Here, the basis is the <em>the universe we live in</em>,
which remains constant over all places and all times within
that universe.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I must say that my sympathies are strongly towards
improving over Satoshi.</p>
<p>Though I may not be as brilliant as Satoshi, in the end,
Satoshi is dead and will never contribute to Bitcoin again.
It is the responsibility of us his heirs to drive Bitcoin forward.</p>
