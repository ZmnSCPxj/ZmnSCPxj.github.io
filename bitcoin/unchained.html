<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In cryptocurrency, smart contracts have traditionally been implemented
as part of the consensus rules of some blockchain.</p>
<p>In particular, innovations
(or &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; like the infamous Ethereum Meta-Bug
of allowing Turing-completeness and thereby footguns)
on smart contracting languages have often needed a blockchain
to provide even just a minimal proof-of-concept.
(I am not even referring to a minimal viable product here.)</p>
<p>Now, launching a new blockchain requires one of the following:</p>
<p><ul>
	<li><p>Creating your own token.</p></li>
	<li><p>Becoming a sidechain reusing some existing token.</p></li>
</ul></p>
<p>The former is prone to accusations that the point of the innovation
is to pump the token rather than the token supporting the innovation.
The latter requires, with current Bitcoin (early 2019),
using a federation,
which is essentially a joint <a href='custodial.html'>custodian</a>
of the money in the mainchain.</p>
<p>This writeup, then, proposes an alternate method of creating
a smart contract platform while requiring only basic functionality
on some hosting blockchain,
reusing the same token,
without launching a separate blockchain,
while reducing (but not eliminating) the custodian theft risk
that federated sidechains have.
Practical deployment will probably require a federation,
but at least eliminates the creation of
<a href='https://www.cryptocurrencyguide.org/blockchain-is-just-a-very-slow-database-says-cryptocurrency-experts/'>a very slow database</a>.</p>

<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p><ul>
	<li><p><a href='https://gavintech.blogspot.com/2014/06/bit-thereum.html'>bit-thereum</a>; it talks about oracles, with the strong implication that oracles are necessary for most expected smart contract usages.
		From a certain point of view, oracles, escrow services, and smart contract platforms as proposed under this mechanism, are all &ldquo;the same&rdquo; thing; only the oracle is expected to inspect the material world, whereas the smart contract platform need not do so.
		The &ldquo;as long as everyone agrees&rdquo; escape hatch seems to be new in this writeup, however.</p></li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><ul>
<li><p>We do not need to support a smart contract platform
as part of consensus rules of a blockchain.</p></li>
<li><p>Practical deployments of this idea
probably still require a federation.</p></li>
<li><p>This mechanism supports greater privacy
than available on typical &ldquo;improved smart contract&rdquo; blockchains.</p></li>
<li><p>This mechanism allows all participants
to consensually decide to switch to a different smart contract
(for example, if a bug is found in a complex smart contract,
it is possible to switch to a patched version)
or even switch to a different
smart contract platform.</p></li>
<li><p>Incoming improvements for SegWit v1,
as expected as of April 2019,
greatly improve this mechanism further.</p></li>
</ul></p>

<h1>Escrow Protocol</h1>
<p>An escrow protocol is possible to implement using a 2-of-3
multisignature.
The keys are the seller key, the buyer key, and the escrow key.</p>
<p>If the buyer and seller are able to come to an agreement on
what happened, then they sign a transaction sending the tokens
to the correct destination.
However, if there is a dispute between them, the escrow
service steps in and sorts out where the money should go to.</p>
<p>Generalizing this to a protocol with more than two participants
aside from the escrow service, we find that there are two
major branches:</p>
<p><ol>
	<li><p>Every participant agrees to the result without involving the escrow service.</p></li>
	<li><p>One participant disagrees and brings in the escrow service to mediate.</p></li>
</ol></p>
<p>For the two-participant case, a 2-of-3 multisignature
is the optimum way to provide the above contract.
For more than two participants,
we can use a script
which may be claimed with either of the below branches:</p>
<p><ol>
	<li><p>N-of-N multisignature, one key per participant.</p></li>
	<li><p>OR, 2-of-2 multisignature, one key from escrow service, other key is shared key known to all participants but <em>not</em> the escrow service.</p></li>
</ol></p>
<p>If every participant agrees, the first branch is taken.
If a participant disagrees, they bring in the escrow service,
which determines where the money should go,
and then sign what the escrow service determines
using the common key.</p>

<h1>Smart Contract Platforms as Programmable Escrow Services</h1>
<p>Smart contracts impose conditions
on how a fund can be spent.
In case of any dispute, the smart contract effectively decides
how the fund gets spent.</p>
<p>A platform that can plausibly enforce a smart contract
then works as an escrow that determines who controls the money
according to the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>Thus a smart contract platform is a programmable escrow service.</p>

<h1>Smart Contracts Unchained, or, Ethereum Blockchain Considered Extraneous</h1>
<p>A smart contract platform, rather than implementing a completely new blockchain,
can make use of an existing blockchain with simple smart contract functionality.</p>
<p>This is done by making the platform an escrow service with the
above given simple smart contract.</p>
<p>The escrow service key is tweaked with a commitment to the
contract that must be interpreted,
using standard pay-to-contract protocols.
For example, given the smart contract platform public key <code>E</code>,
a smart contract serialization <code>s</code>,
and a suitable cryptographic hash function <code>h</code>,
the tweaked public key <code>T</code> is:</p>
<pre>T = E + h(E | s) * G</pre>
<p>Given the private key <code>e</code> of the escrow,
the above has corresponding private key <code>t = e + h((e * G) | s)</code>.</p>
<p>Given public keys <code>P1</code>...<code>Pn</code> of each of the <code>n</code> participant,
and the common public key <code>C</code> known by all participants but
not the smart contract platform, the script to pay to is:</p>
<pre>
OP_IF
  &lt;n&gt; &lt;P1&gt;...&lt;Pn&gt; &lt;n&gt;
OP_ELSE
  2 &lt;T&gt; &lt;C&gt; 2
OP_ENDIF
OP_CHECKMULTISIG
</pre>
<p>Each participant executes an interpreter of the smart contract language,
and if all participants agree on the interpretation,
sign with their participant keys.
But if a participant diverges, they send the smart contract and
any inputs required to the smart contract platform service.
The smart contract platform service then signs using the tweaked key,
and any participant can then add the common signature.</p>
<p>In order for the smart contract platform to be profitable,
it is likely to extract a fee for each usage.</p>
<h2>Tr*st, the five-letter curse word</h2>
<p>The smart contract platform service cannot steal funds without the
cooperation of at least one participant.
Tr*st is still needed to an extent, but is reduced compared to a full custodian.</p>
<p>Tr*st issues can be mitigated, as in the federated sidechains case,
by creating a federation that runs the smart contract platform.
The federation member keys can be tweaked with the smart contract script as above,
then use whatever multisignature scheme
the federation judges reasonable.</p>
<p>For instance, a 9-of-12 federation smart contract platform might do:</p>
<pre>
OP_IF
  &lt;n&gt; &lt;P1&gt;...&lt;Pn&gt; &lt;n&gt;
OP_ELSE
  &lt;C&gt; OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY 9 &lt;T1&gt;...&lt;T12&gt; 12
OP_ENDIF
OP_CHECKMULTISIG
</pre>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>This scheme massively increases privacy.
If all participants agree (hopefully the common case)
on the smart contract interpretation,
then the smart contract platform never needs to learn
about the details or even the existence of the contract.
Contrast this to almost every blockchain implementation
of an &ldquo;improved&rdquo; smart contract system,
where the smart contract needs to be published onchain,
publicly visible for all to see,
greatly reducing privacy and fungibility.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that
if the smart contract turns out
to have a breaking bug,
the participants can get together and agree to <em>not</em>
enforce the contract,
and instead spend the fund according to their off-contract agreement.
For example, they can agree to a modified smart contract
that has been bugfixed.
Thus, buggy smart contracts
do not require a
<a href='https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-executes-blockchain-hard-fork-return-dao-investor-funds'>blockchain rollback</a>
in order to fix,
or even any interaction with the smart contract platform.</p>
<p>Yet another benefit is resilience to the disappearance
of the smart contract platform.
If the smart contract platform disappears,
the participants can still execute the contract themselves,
and if they agree,
can sign a spend that still follows the smart contract
in spite of the smart contract platform disappearing.
If the code for the smart contract platform is open source,
then a new smart contract platform implementation can be created,
and the participants can agree to switch
to the new smart contract platform implementation
in much the same way they can switch
from a buggy smart contract to a bugfixed one
as in the previous benefit.</p>
<p>All these benefits arise from the first branch of the script:
as long as everybody agrees, anything can be done,
without asking the smart contract platform
to enforce the contract committed to.</p>
<h2>Participant-selected Federation</h2>
<p>Currently, smart contract platforms implemented on federated sidechains
indicate a fixed set of signatories as the federation.</p>
<p>However, this mechanism does not require a blockchain,
and therefore does not require a monolithic set of rules
that is agreed-upon by consensus of everyone using
the platform.</p>
<p>In shorter sentences, this mechanism
allows the participants to select the federation
instead of a smart contract platform defining the federation.</p>
<p>If it is possible to advertise that one is willing
to serve in a federation,
participants in a smart contract may select
the federation members
and agree on how much is considered a sufficient quorum.</p>

<h1>Improvements From Upcoming Bitcoin Innovations</h1>
<p>Upcoming (as of mid-2019) improvements to Bitcoin
greatly increase the power
of the Smart Contracts Unchained technique.</p>
<h2>MuSig and Schnorr-like Signatures</h2>
<p>MuSig allows generation of threshold multisignature keys.
This allows an m-of-n federation to provide only a single
public key for smart contracts.
In addition, the n-of-n multisignature of the participants
can be compressed to a single public key.</p>
<h2>Taproot</h2>
<p>One branch of the script involves a simple n-of-n multisignature
of the participants.
The other branch is more complex as it involves a singlesignature
and a threshold multisignature
(if the smart contract platform is implemented as a federation).
This is precisely the usecase that Taproot was designed for.</p>
<p>This massively increases privacy,
because in the case where every participant agrees,
nobody knows that the smart contract platform was even used.</p>
<h2><code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code></h2>
<p>Even if a participant disagrees, it is still best if the
smart contract platform
never learns which exact UTXO is being disputed.
By signing with <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code>,
the smart contract platform does not need to know
the transaction output being spent;
it only needs to know the smart contract and the inputs to the smart contract,
as well as the value of the UTXO being spent.</p>
<p>Now, if the signature created by the smart contract platform
is used onchain,
then the smart contract platform can simply scan the blockchain
for the signature and learn the UTXO being spent.</p>
<p>However, the existence of this signature defining where the
funds will go to, can then be used to convince participants to
sign the same transaction using their participant keys.
Since the UTXO is now spendable with the platform signature,
participants cannot gain from refusing to sign,
and can retain privacy from the smart contract platform
by signing.</p>
<h2>Modified Mechanism</h2>
<p>The mechanism can then be modified so as to
pay to a Taproot address.
The Taproot public key is the n-of-n multisignature of all the participants,
while the Taproot script is:</p>
<pre>&lt;T&gt; OP_CHECKDLSVERIFY &lt;C&gt; OP_CHECKDLS</pre>
<p>The <code>T</code> is a tweaked version of the federation-generated
threshold multisignature public key, and <code>C</code> is a
common key known by all the participants.</p>


<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Federated sidechains like Rootstock are extraneous
since their primary innovation is a smart contract platform.
However, as we present here,
it is possible for a federation to provide a smart contract platform
without implementing something as inefficient as an entire new blockchain.
Instead, the Bitcoin blockchain can be reused without modification.
Further, the benefits in privacy and smart-contract-patching
greatly bring to question whether even Ethereum,
which is supposedly not controlled by a federation,
is necessary or desirable.</p>
<p>Liquid, at least, provides confidential transactions and assets,
which cannot be provided via this mechanism.
However, its innovations to smart contracts, such as
Simplicity and covenants,
can be prototyped using this mechanism instead of on Liquid.</p>
<p>Bitcoin SCRIPT has many limitations, most of which exist
in order to prevent block verification time from exploding.
A simple smart contract platform that lifts those limitations
can be useful,
since this Smart Contracts Unchained means that verification time
of Bitcoin SCRIPT is no longer an issue,
as there is no blockchain needed
to enforce the rules for the smart contract platform.</p>
