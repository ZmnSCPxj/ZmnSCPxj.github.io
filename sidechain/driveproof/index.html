<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Prior to this work, there were two primary proposed
implementations of sidechains.</p>
<ol>
 <li><dfn>SPV proof-based sidechains</dfn>, as described in the
     original <a href='https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf'>sidechains
     paper</a>.  Sidechains have their own proof-of-work, and
     sections of the sidechain header chain are published on
     the mainchain in a "compact SPV proof" which attests that
     a side-to-main withdrawal exists on the sidechain.</li>
 <li><dfn>Drivechains</dfn>, as described in the
     <a href='http://www.drivechain.info/'>drivechains website</a>.
     Sidechains are merge-mined, and the existence of side-to-main
     withdrawals on the sidechain are attested to by miner voting on
     the mainchain.  Sztorc's proposal also includes "blind" merge
     mining, where the sidechain block assembler is separate from
     the mainchain miner, and pays the latter to commit to "correct"
     block header hashes.</li></ol>
<p><dfn>Driveproof</dfn> combines elements of both proposals.
Specifically:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Sidechains are <strong>merge-mined</strong>.</li>
 <li>The merge-mining does not commit to header hashes as in
     traditional merge-mining; instead, sidechain headers are
     reduced to the minimum, and <strong>the entire sidechain
     header is published on the mainchain</strong>.</li>
 <li>As the chain of headers is published on the mainchain
     continuously as part of merge-mining, an <strong>SPV
     proof is being continuously published</strong>; there is
     no need to compact an SPV proof at withdrawal, since the
     mainchain already has the SPV proof as part of
     merge-mining the sidechain.</li>
 <li>Sidechains may be "blind" merge-mined, i.e. arbitrary owners
     of maincoin may pay miners to insert particular block
     headers onto the sidechain; this means <strong>the
     economic majority controls the sidechain</strong>, in a
     way that is not done in drivechains, since the miner voting
     of drivechains is eliminated in favor of economic-majority
     voting for the true history of the sidechain.</li></ol>

<h1>Sidechain Headers</h1>
<p>At its core, a blockchain is simply a Merklized singly-linked
list, with the genesis block as the end-of-list indicator.</p>
<p>At an absolute minimum, a blockchain header needs to contain
only two things: a commitment to the transactions in the block,
and a commitment to the previous blockchain header.</p>
<p>We may argue, perhaps, that new innovations may require that
sidechains have additional fields in their headers, and that a
one-size-fits-all is too much of a restriction on sidechains.</p>
<p>I would then point out the fields below:</p>
<ol>
 <li>extraNonce</li>
 <li>SegWit witness commitment</li></ol>
<p>In Bitcoin, because the header format must be fixed forever
unless hardforked, both of the above fields are not in the
block header.  Instead, they are in the coinbase transaction.
The same technique can be used by sidechains: header fields
may be placed in a sidechain's equivalent of a coinbase
transaction.</p>
<p>Indeed, sidechain Merkle trees need not be balanced.  Sidechains
may have a special "transaction" which is not really a transaction,
which contains the data the header would have contained.  This could be
the sole child of one side of the root Merkle tree node, with the
other child being the root of the balanced Merkle tree of
transactions.</p>
<p>Thus, in driveproof, a sidechain block header is composed of:</p>
<ol>
 <li><code>sidechainId</code>, 16 bytes that identify a sidechain.</li>
 <li><code>hashMerkleRoot</code>, 32 bytes that commit to the
     sideblock's transactions.</li>
 <li><code>hashPrevBlock</code>, 32 bytes that are the hash of the
     previous sidechain block header.</li></ol>

<h1>Sidechain Miners and Mainchain Miners</h1>
<p>In driveproof, sidechain miners "hire" mainchain miners to
insert entire sidechain headers on the mainchain.
This is why this technique is called "sidechain headers on
mainchain."</p>
