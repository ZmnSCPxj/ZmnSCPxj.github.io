<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Sidechains offer a very important ability to Bitcoin:
the ability to absorb the abilities of altchains, and hereby retain
its dominance in the cryptocurrency space.
With sidechains, Bitcoin can not only acquire innovations from
alternative chains, but also bring to bear its important
first-mover advantage and network effect.</p>
<p>The key problem with all side-to-main pegs is that the strength of
the peg is dependent on the "healthiness" of the sidechain.  But
arguably, the peg <em>must</em> be strong, at <em>precisely</em> the
point where the sidechain is unhealthy, and <em>people are leaving
the sidechain</em>.</p>

<h1>SPV Proof Sidechains</h1>
<p>The original sidechains paper introduced the use of SPV proofs
to prove ownership of sidecoin.
An <dfn>SPV proof</dfn> is, at its heart, simply a sequence of
connected header blocks (a <dfn>compact SPV proof</dfn> is a way
of expressing an SPV proof in a shorter form, such as a
<a href='https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/963.pdf'>Proof of Proof of
Work</a>).
In addition, the same mechanism
(SPV proof) is used as a fraud proof to deny a withdrawal attempt
(an SPV proof used in this manner is called a "<dfn>reorg
proof</dfn>").</p>
<p>In the original formulation, sidechains would be mined
"traditionally", using some proof-of-work algorithm, and the
sidechain would have its own set of miners.  The Bitcoin chain
would simply accept an SPV proof that bitcoins were locked on
the sidechain in order to unlock coins on the Bitcoin chain.
The sidechain would also accept an SPV proof that bitcoins were
locked on the Bitcoin chain in order to unlock coins on the
sidechain.</p>
<h2>Sidechain Miner Incentives Under SPV Proof Sidechains</h2>
<p>On the sidechain, an amount B of bitcoins is in use, and are
locked on the mainchain (it is <dfn>backing</dfn> the coins on
the sidechain).  On each sidechain block, an amount F
of bitcoins per block is paid as fees to sidechain miners.</p>
<p>On the mainchain, an SPV proof of N sidechain block headers
will be accepted to authorize a withdrawal.  On the mainchain,
sidechain withdrawals are delayed by D blocks to allow reorg
proofs to gainsay the withdrawal.  Let us assume for now that
sidechain blocks and mainchain blocks are discovered at the
same rate, 10 minutes per block.</p>
<p>For a sidechain miner with &gt;50% hashpower on the sidechain,
if B &gt; F * (N + D), the sidechain miner should steal the
sidechain's entire backing fund.  Theft is done by creating an
invalid sidechain block with a withdrawal of the entire B to a
mainchain address the thief control, and creating a sequence of
block headers long enough to cause the mainchain Bitcoin to
accept it as an SPV proof and too long for a honest miners to
provide a reorg proof.</p>
<p>In (N + D) amount of time, the &gt;50% sidechain miner can
build a longer chain than the rest of the sidechain miners.
The sidechain miner can earn B bitcoin in
(N + D) blocks running an invalid sidechain fork, but only earn
F * (N + D) in the same amount of blocks running a valid sidechain
fork.  If B &gt; F * (N + D), then the sidechain miner should
steal.</p>
<p>Now it can be argued that even a sidechain miner seeking
long-term earnings would prefer to keep the sidechain alive and
healthy, and not steal the backing bitcoin fund B.</p> 
<p>But consider the end-of-life scenario for a sidechain.  When a
sidechain approaches its end-of-life, then the sidechain miners
know, for certain, that the future sidechain fees F will, from
now on, be a fraction of the total remaining backing fund B.
This is because sidechain users will start processing withdrawals
from the sidechain, eventually reducing B, and only a fraction of
the bitcoins in B will ever be paid as fees to the sidechain.</p>
<p>We may counter that end-of-life is an unlikely scenario.
But consider the reasons why a sidechain may reach end-of-life:</p>
<ol>
 <li>The sidechain has <em>succeeded</em>.  It has proven that its
     features are desired by many users, that the new features do
     not break Bitcoin's security, and so on.  Because of this, the
     sidechain features are then added to mainchain.
     But, since the mainchain now
     contains the sidechain features while having the full security
     of mainchain, there will be little to no future use for the
     sidechain, and any sidechain miners can definitely predict
     that future F will approach 0 very quickly, compared to the
     current backing fund B.
     It would be sadly ironic for the users of a sidechain to show
     its success and desirability, and get rewarded by having their
     bitcoins stolen when the sidechain features are added directly
     to mainchain.</li>
 <li>The sidechain attempts to implement a <em>difficult feature and
     fails</em>.
     Perhaps an unexpected security bug is found, or some other
     unforeseen catastrophe.
     It may be possible that not all sidechain users may be
     vulnerable to the sidechain's vulnerability, so at least
     their orderly exit from the sidechain should be supported.
     Alternatively the developers may have overestimated the
     overall benefit the sidechain provides.
     Mistakes may have been made, but for some kinds of
     speculative functionality, it may be reasonable to allow
     the developers to change their mind and recommend the
     cessation of their sidechain.
     As large a pool of users of the sidechain should be able to
     safely exit even in this situation, if it can be arranged.</li>
 <li>The end-of-life is made into a <em>self-fulfilling
     prophecy</em>.
     An attack is started by a sidechain miner with just below 50%
     hashpower.  This sidechain miner then offers bribes to other
     sidechain miners to steal the money.
     Theft success increases the relative expected utility of the
     bribe versus future fees F, so rational sidechain miners may
     consider instead joining the thief to kill the sidechain
     rather than fight off the thief to retain future fees F.
     This may be assisted by planting false information about a
     vulnerability.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is precisely at end-of-life
that the side-to-main peg should be most secure, but it is at
end-of-life that an SPV proof side-to-main peg is most
vulnerable.</p>

<h1>Drivechain</h1>
<p>The other primary alternative is drivechains, where sidechains
are merge-mined with Bitcoin, and withdrawals are validated by
mainchain miner voting.</p>
<p>A proponent of drivechains, Paul Sztorc,
<a href='https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-September/014967.html'>claims
that the miner voting in drivechain accomplishes the same tasks as
SPV proofs of any kind</a>.
If so, then drivechains should be vulnerable to the same issues that
plague SPV Proof sidechains at end-of-life.</p>
<h2>Merge Mining</h2>
<p>Merge mining sidechains on the mainchain is desirable, as in
the end it is the same token that is being protected.</p>
<p>In particular, if the same proof-of-work function would be
used by a separately-mined sidechain, then different disjoint
sets of coins will have separate disjoint sets of miners
protecting them, weakening the token security overall.
Merge-mining means that a single set of miners protects the
entire set of coins.</p>
<p>The drawback of merge mining is that, to a merge miner,
sidechains are not optional but rather mandatory.
As sidechains have their own blocks, this effectiely
increases the bandwidth and latency requirements on
mainchain miners.</p>
<p>The increase in cost of operating a mine limits membership
to the "caste" of miners.</p>
<h2>"Blind" Merge Mining</h2>
<p>"Blind" merge mining attempts to reduce the cost of starting a
new mine by allowing sidechain miners to be separate from mainchain
miners.
It is based on an opcode, <code>OP_BRIBEVERIFY</code>.
It is called "blind" in the sense that the mainchain miner is
unaware of the content of the sidechain block being mined.</p>
<p><code>OP_BRIBEVERIFY</code> takes a single argument, the hash
of the sidechain block concatenated with an identifier of the
sidechain.
As it replaces an <code>OP_NOP</code>, it leaves the same
argument on the stack.
The opcode then checks if the sidechain block specified was
merge-mined on the coinbase of the mainchain block it is in.</p>
<p>In further discussion below, I will talk to you as if you are
a sidechain miner who does not have any mainchain hashpower
yourself.</p>
<p>The intended use of <code>OP_BRIBEVERIFY</code> appears to be
in this manner:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Have a working relationship with a particular mainchain
     miner.</li>
 <li>Request a public key from the miner.</li>
 <li>Generate a sidechain block, then pay for the block to be
     published by sending a transaction to your mainchain
     miner paying to: <code>&lt;sidechainBlockHash&gt;
     OP_BRIBEVERIFY OP_DROP &lt;minerPubKey&gt; OP_CHECKSIG</code>.</li>
 <li>The mainchain miner includes your sidechain block hash in
     the coinbase, then publishes your transaction and an additional
     transaction that spends it to an address the mainchain miner
     controls.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above technique has the disadvantages below:</p>
<ul>
 <li>You need to have working relationships with all mainchain
     miners.  If a miner who you don't have a relationship with
     got a mainchain block, you have no chance of publishing your
     sidechain block.</li>
 <li>Mainchain miners get paid immediately.  This is in contrast
     with normal mainchain fees, which require 100 blocks of
     maturity to ensure that mainchain miners want to keep the
     mainchain alive at least until maturation of the fees.</li>
 <li>Another transaction is needed for the miner to claim the
     fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>The technique below is an alternative:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Put your funds into a P2SH to: <code>OP_IF OP_BRIBEVERIFY
     OP_DROP OP_ENDIF &lt;yourPubKey&gt; OP_CHECKSIG</code>.</li>
 <li>Generate a sidechain block, then redeem your funds using
     the input stack <code>&lt;yourSignature&gt;
     &lt;sidechainBlockHash&gt; 1</code>.  Send your funds to
     another P2SH with similar script as before.  The output
     should be less than the input: the mainchain miner gets
     paid by the mining fee of this transaction.</li>
 <li>Broadcast your transaction to all miners, possibly using
     normal Bitcoin transaction broadcast.</li>
 <li>The mainchain miner that wants to get your fee will have
     to publish the given sidechain block hash in the coinbase.</li>
</ol>
<p>This technique has the advantage that it gets broadcast to
all miners, and the mainchain miner gets paid in the coinbase,
which requires maturation, and does not require another
transaction to claim the bribe.</p>
<p>However the disadvantage is that the mempool rules are to
your disadvantage: if your transaction is <em>not</em>
published because somebody else bribed higher, your
transaction remains in the mempool with the same sidechain
block hash (which will probably be a past sidechain block
later and will be orphaned).
Replacing that transaction with an updated sidechain block
hash requires a higher fee if used with RBF, which may not
be feasible if the next sidechain block fees are lower.</p>
<p>In addition, one reason why the first technique is
preferred is that it gives you some control over the
voting.
If a miner is misvoting (voting for an invalid withdrawal,
abstaining, or voting against a valid withdrawal) you can
simply stop offering sidechain block hashes to that miner.</p>
<p>Without this control, a mainchain miner can take your
offered bribe and vote incorrectly.
Without this control, the incentives for a
mainchain miner to steal funds at end-of-life change: it can
separately receive the fees F from the sidechain (via the fees
paid for "blind" merge mining) <em>and</em> steal the backing
funds B of the sidechain at the same time.
But even with this control, sidechain end-of-life still
requires trust in the miners of the sidechain, and the
miners in drivechain will actually be the mainchain
miners even under "blind" merge mining, since <em>you</em>
do not have the vote.</p>
<p>Ultimately, to my mind, if blind merge mining truly
incentivizes a separation of sidechain and mainchain miners,
then it would be trivial for a thief to offer the voters
&mdash; mainchain miners &mdash;
an out-of-band incentive to vote for an invalid withdrawal
of the entire backing fund of the sidechain.</p>

<h1>Mining and SPV</h1>
<p>Proof-of-work mining will centralize inevitably..</p>
<p>Currently, the major cost of mining operations is electricity
costs.
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_pricing#Global_comparison'>Here
is a table of electric power prices around the world</a>.
The major takeaway from this table is that the electricity costs
of a mine can vary by as much as a factor of 33 depending on what
country it is built in.</p>
<p>This fact implies that there may be economically-significant
populations
whose hashpower representation is disproportionately small,
simply because of high electricity charges locally.</p>
<p>Electricity prices vary significantly due to the difficulty
of transporting and storing electricity.
Storing electricity in electrolytic batteries is energy-inefficient,
and the batteries slowly discharge over time even when unused.
Even transporting electricity by fixed wires will dissipate some
energy over distance.
These factors weaken the arbitraging of electrical power.</p>
<p>(I neglect here the fact that there are other issues involved
in mining: Internet bandwidth and latency, as well as
local climate &mdash; in some climates the heat emitted by
mining devices is a desirable alternative to heaters, while in
others the heat is an additional liability requiring even more
electrical power to dissipate.)</p>
<p>Indeed, even if mining devices become commodities &mdash;
shirt ironing devices use a miner instead of heating element,
for example &mdash; mining will still be higher in places
where electrical prices are low.</p>
<p>There are arguments that increases in mining in places
with low electricity prices will increase to the point
that the electricity prices there will rise, making it
economically feasible to start mines elsewhere and thus
ensuring decentralization.
However, price is determined by supply and demand, and
presumably locations currently with low electricity prices
have high supply relative to current demand.
In order for the electricity price to equalize, demand for
electricity would have to rise in proportion to the local
supply, implying that the concentration of miners would
still follow available electrical supply, and would still
fail to be distributed according to economic significance.
In short, mining will still be centralized in locations
with high electrical supply.</p>
<p>Indeed, the fact that mining ASICs are developed and
fabricated in China or nearby countries is misleading:
even if ASICs were developed all over the world, there
will be larger mines in places with cheaper electricity.</p>
<h2>Why Does Bitcoin Still Work?</h2>
<p>If Bitcoin mining is so centralized, why does Bitcoin
still work?</p>
<p>We should consider that mining is constrained by the
rules imposed by fullnodes.
Thus, in case of miner centralization, in general the
attacks below are what remain feasible:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Censorship.</li>
 <li>Double-spending.</li>
 <li>Level-crossing attacks (i.e. war, terrorist attack,
     government coercion, or other physical attack on
     collocated mining hardware).</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, the first two attacks impose an economic
cost on the attacker, and their economic benefit to the
attacker may not outweigh the costs.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Censorship means turning down fee-paying
     transactions.
     If users respond by increasing fees on censored
     transactions, censoring miners are turning down
     those fees and losing potential earnings.
     (The increase in fees may effectively censor certain
     transactions, however)</li>
 <li>Double-spending attempts are not costless to the
     miner: work needs to be re-done in order to
     rewrite recent history.
     The cost of rewriting history becomes higher as
     the number of confirmations required increases.
     Finally, the benefit to the attacker of
     double-spending is limited by the amount of coin
     the attacker controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, specialized producers
of a specific good are economically bound to adhere to
the desires of the consumers; that is, miners will
follow the desires of the hodlers of coins, regardless
of centralization.</p>
<p>However, we must take note that specialization leads
to fragility to level-crossing physical attacks on the
network.</p>
<h2>Centralization and SPV</h2>
<p>The analysis above assumes that every user directly
or indirectly runs a mainchain fullnode.</p>
<p>Under SPV, however, another attack may be performed
by a miner;
specifically, a miner may create an invalid block
where it is invalidly paid a large amount of fees,
generate a small chain on top of that, and use that
chain to fool an SPV client into thinking it has been
paid.
Such an "<dfn>inflation attack</dfn>" would be much
stronger in the case of centralization and prevalent
SPV.
It also has a higher incentive than double-spend
attacks, as the purported amount does not need to be
actually controlled by the attacker.</p>
<p>(It is important to note that the fees received by
a miner have no consensus limit and
<a href='https://blockchain.info/en/tx/cc455ae816e6cdafdb58d54e35d4f46d860047458eacf1c7405dc634631c570d'>miners
have received very high fees before</a>.
This is important as transaction-tracing proofs like
Peter Todd's Proofchains
terminate at a coinbase transaction, whose value
validity can only be judged by looking at all
transactions in the block it is in.)</p>
<p>For a "normal" SPV client that is controlled directly
by a human user, this can be mitigated by the human
user manually verifying the blocks being received by
the SPV client using some kind of block explorer.
Automated SPV clients, however, will either be under
permanent risk of inflation attack, or will require
constant human supervision (and hence, trust that the
human supervisors are paying attention, and not, for
example, forgetting to turn on their alarm clocks and
oversleeping).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, SPV proof sidechains and drivechains
both turn the mainchain into an automated SPV client of
the sidechain.
In particular, under drivechains, mainchain miners are
forced to pay attention to the sidechain in order to
determine which way to vote.
In effect, it requires that mainchain miners run
sidechain fullnodes for all existing sidechains in
order to prevent inflation attacks on any sidechain.
This also means that sidechains translate directly into
softforked block size increases, with the same results
as other block size increases: increased pressure for
mainchain miners to collocate in order to improve
transmission of both mainchain and sidechain block
data.</p>

<h1>Sidechain End-of-life and Permissionless Innovation</h1>
<p>The issue of sidechain end-of-life interacts badly with
the stated intent of permissionless innovation.</p>
<p>Consider for example a situation, where a reasonably-popular
sidechain already exists, that has many similarities to the
mainchain.
Let us also consider the situation, that development of this
sidechain is centralized, in comparison with the Core
mainchain.</p>
<p>Suppose a bright mind develops some idea for a mainchain
feature, and creates a sidechain that is little more than
mainchain in addition with this useful new feature.
In a few months, it becomes obvious that the feature is
useful, desirable, and has little or no negative effect.</p>
<p>However, the developers of the pre-existing sidechain
notice this feature, and implement it also on their own
sidechain.
This is reasonably easy as the sidechain developers are
more centralized than Core mainchain is.</p>
<p>From then on, the sidechain with a new feature is at
end-of-life: the pre-existing sidechain not only has the
new feature, it also has (by virtue of being older) better
network effect, and possibly other features as well.
Users then desire to leave the sidechain.
Again, as I pointed out earlier, at end-of-life, expected
future fees are expected to drop, and present backing
funds become a target for theft.
In addition, the new sidechain is likely to be a
relatively small sidechain, and the rest of the Bitcoin
community may be unwilling to economically sacrifice the
Bitcoin network to punish those who steal from the
small sidechain using "nuclear options".</p>
<p>This suggests that permissionless innovation for
existing chains already pegged to the mainchain is
risky.
One would have to create sidechains that are incompatible
with mainchain and pre-existing sidechains (such as a
MimbleWimble sidechain, or other chain with drastically
different transaction format), or risk end-of-life.</p>
