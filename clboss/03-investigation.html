<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This writeup is of interest to Lightning Network developers who
want to make their own &ldquo;autopilot&rdquo;, but may also be of
interest to curious node operators who want to know how CLBOSS
treats nodes for making channels with.</p>
<p>One of the first things that was automated on the Lightning
Network was to select nodes on the network and make channels with
those nodes.
After all, good liquidity to the rest of the network is vital for
actual use of Lightning.
Thus, <code>lnd</code> developers quickly implemented and deployed
an &ldquo;autopilot&rdquo; that performed this task.</p>
<p>One can argue that CLBOSS is just the lame attempt of some
cryptokid wannabe to implement autopilot for C-Lightning instead of
just contributing to <code>lnd</code> which everyone is using
anyway.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things that struck me with most autopilot
implementations is that they select a node and <em>immediately</em>
make a channel to it.</p>
<p>But an important figure of merit is how much uptime the
selected node actually has.</p>
<p>Thus, CLBOSS also performs <dfn>investigation</dfn>, where it
also checks the uptime of the node before it actually makes channels.</p>
<p>Investigation is separate from selection.
Various modules propose nodes to make channels with.
Then the proposals enter investigation.
It is the latter part, the investigation, which <em>this</em>
writeup will discuss.</p>
<p>In CLBOSS, we always periodically run the algorithms to
<em>select</em> nodes to channel with, even if we have no spare
onchain liquidity to actually make the channels.
This is to allow investigation to take its time to determine the
uptime of nodes.
We should note in particular that judging uptime is time-consuming
since we need to continuously check if the candidate is online or
not; just because it is online <em>now</em> does not mean it
actually is online &gt;99.5% of the time, you need to check back
later regularly.
Selecting nodes from the gossip map is just pure computation in
comparison to that, and is much less time-consuming.</p>

<h1>Proposals and Patrons</h1>
<p>When a module wants to propose a channel to a particular node,
the rest of CLBOSS actually has an important question:
Why?</p>
<p>Thus, CLBOSS has a concept of a channel <dfn>proposal</dfn>
and its <dfn>patron</dfn>.
The <dfn>proposal</dfn> is the actual node that some module is
proposing to actually build a channel to.
The <dfn>patron</dfn> is the reason why we think that the node
is good to channel to &mdash; i.e. the patron is good for
some module-specific reason, and the proposal has good
liquidity to its patron.</p>
<p>This is important since <em>making</em> a channel to some
proposal later raises this question: <em>how much do we
put into the channel?</em></p>
<p>CLBOSS determines how much to put into a channel to some
<code>proposal</code> by determining the size of the channel(s)
between the proposal and its <code>patron</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, a vital part of all the autopilot algorithms in
CLBOSS is that every <code>proposal</code> ought to have a
<code>patron</code>, because the size of the channel to the
<code>proposal</code> is determined by the size of the channel(s)
between the <code>proposal</code> and the <code>patron</code>.</p>
<p>In effect, we consider the <code>patron</code> as a sort of
proxy for &ldquo;the rest of the Lightning Network&rdquo;.
If the <code>proposal</code> only has, say, a 20mBTC channel to
the <code>patron</code>, it is probably risky to put more than,
say, 10mBTC into a channel with the <code>proposal</code>, since
it is likely that the liquidity to &ldquo;the rest of the
Lightning Network&rdquo; would be limited to 10mBTC.</p>
<p>Now you might say, maybe instead of having a
<code>patron</code>, just have the proposing module indicate
the amount that should be put in the channel.</p>
<p>The problem with that is, as was stated in the Introduction,
we <em>investigate</em> proposals for their uptime, and uptime
investigation <em>takes time</em>.
The time from the initial proposal, to the time we actually
build the channel, can be several days, weeks, or months.
During that time, network conditions might have changed, and
the original proposed amount may no longer be reasonable for
the current liquidity of the proposed node.</p>
<p>Thus, having a <code>patron</code> lets us update in case
the liquidity of the <code>proposal</code> changes in the
future while we were investigating the proposal.
When we have some onchain funds that are ready to put into
channels, we query the liquidity between the
<code>proposal</code> and its <code>patron</code>, so we
get the most up-to-date information on how much funds it is
reasonable to put into the new channel.</p>
<h2>Patron Matchmaking</h2>
<p>Modules that want to propose nodes for making channels
need to provide the proposal together with its patron,
as mentioned</p>
<p>However, at least one module is unable to provide a
patron.
Thus, the
<code>Boss::Mod::ChannelCandidateMatchmaker</code> module
takes such patronless proposals and finds a patron for
them.</p>
<p>Now, we have mentioned a few times that CLBOSS will
investigate proposals continuously.
Obviously, such proposals-under-investigation need to be
kept track of, so CLBOSS has a list of them stored
on-disk.</p>
<p>When a patronless proposal is brought up, the matchmaker
will ask for all existing proposals.
It then shuffles this list of proposals.</p>
<p>Then, it attempts a <code>getroute</code> from the
patronless proposal to the existing proposal.
If a route is found from the patronless proposal to an
existing proposal, we take the first hop of that route as
the patron for the previously-patronless proposal.
If no routes are found, then the module simply drops the
patronless proposal.</p>
<h2>Dowsing</h2>
<p>As mentioned, the reason why we have a
<code>proposal</code> and a <code>patron</code> is
because we use the liquidity between them to determine
how much to put in a channel with the
<code>proposal</code>.</p>
<p>CLBOSS calls this computation <dfn>dowsing</dfn>,
and the module <code>Boss::Mod::Dowser</code> is the
one that computes dowsing.</p>
<p><code>Boss::Mod::Dowser</code> works by repeatedly
performing <code>getroute</code> between the
<code>proposal</code> and its <code>patron</code>,
specifying a <code>maxhops</code> parameter.
The <code>maxhops</code> parameter limits the length
of paths allowed.
As of this writing (mid 2022) the limit is 3 hops.</p>
<p>Then, <code>Boss::Mod::Dowser</code> determines
the capacity of the returned path.
This is simply the smallest channel along the path.</p>
<p>The capacity of the path is then divided by the
length of the path plus 1.
For example, if there is a direct channel between the
<code>proposal</code> and the <code>patron</code>,
then its capacity is divided in half (route length is
1, plus 1, thus divide by 2).</p>
<p>Multiple routes are checked (as of this writing
(mid 2022) the limit is 10 routes checked), and the
capacity divided by the route length plus 1 are summed
up.
This is then the value returned by the
<code>Boss::Mod::Dowser</code> to be used as the
amount to put to a channel with the
<code>proposal</code>.</p>

<h1>Preinvestigation</h1>
<p>As a quick check, CLBOSS <dfn>preinvestigates</dfn>
proposals when they are first broadcast.
This is simply a quick attempt to connect to the
<code>proposal</code> node.
If we fail to connect, we simply drop the proposal.</p>
<p>Modules should use the
<code>Boss::Msg::PreinvestigateChannelCandidates</code>
message to indicate nodes they think are good for
making a channel with, unless they need to use the
matchmaker, in which case they should use the
<code>Boss::Msg::ProposePatronlessChannelCandidate</code>.
The matchmaker will then emit the preinvestigate
message on their behalf.</p>
<p>Notice that the
<code>Boss::Msg::PreinvestigateChannelCandidates</code>
message is plural, i.e. it is about preinvestigating
channel candidate<strong><em>s</em></strong>.
More specifically, the message contains:</p>
<p><ul>
 <li>An ordered list of
     <code>proposal</code>-<code>patron</code> pairs.</li>
 <li>A maximum number of passing proposals to add.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The preinvestigator will go over the ordered list
one by one.
If a <code>proposal</code> passes preinvestigation, we
decrement the number of passing proposals to add and
pass the <code>proposal</code>-<code>patron</code> pair
to the investigator.
If the maximum number of passing proposals drops to zero,
this means the preinvestigator has completed the needed
number of proposals and the rest of the proposals are
simply dropped.
If we reach the last proposal in the list, then we do
nothing more.</p>
<p>A proposal passes preinvestigation if we are able to
successfully connect to the <code>proposal</code>,
<em>and</em> the dowser result for the
<code>proposal</code>-<code>patron</code> pair is at least
5mBTC.</p>
<p>The preimvestigation stage means that channel selection
modules do not have to consider uptime explicitly while
selecting channel candidates.
The channel selection module simply ranks its candidates
according to whatever metric it uses, sorts them best first,
and gives this ordered list of channel candidates to the
preinvestigator.
Then the preinvestigator looks for the best N candidates that
are online right now, so that even if the first ones in the
metric are somehow low-uptime (since a channel selection
module might not use a metric that correlates with uptime)
we give a chance to lower-ranked, but still reasonable, nodes
that <em>do</em> have good uptime.</p>
<p>Now, a <em>single</em> connect attempt, like what the
preinvestigator does, is not an accurate uptime measurement.
But it <em>is</em> correlated with uptime: a high-uptime node
is likely to be able to connect even just once, while a
low-uptime node is likely to fail the connect even if the
attempt is done just once.
This is good enough for the <em>pre</em>investigator, since
any passing proposals will be given to the more in-depth
investigator.</p>
<p>Another important point is that investigation gets a
backseat at a certain phase in the lifetime of the node
under management.
Suppose a node operator starts a completely fresh C-Lightning
node, adds CLBOSS as a plugin, and hands it over several
hundred millibitcoins.
If CLBOSS sits around investigating channel proposals for a
few days before making even a single channel, most operators
are going to assume CLBOSS is not working and uninstall it.
So CLBOSS needs to get some channels up, ASAP, even with
little time to do investigation.</p>
<p>Investigation is thus an <dfn>online algorithm</dfn>.
An online algorithm will gets its inputs one-at-a-time, and
can be queried, at any time, for its output.
An online algorithm will often be able to give rough
estimates at first, then when fed more data, will be able to
give better and more accurate results.
In the case of investigation, its input is the result of an
attempt to connect to the proposal under investigation (i.e.
whether the connect fails or not).
At any time, we an ask investigation to give its best
judgment, even though it might not have a lot of data yet.</p>
<p>As we will see in a later writeup, the initial channel
selection modules tend to use metrics that correlate well
with uptime.
Thus, a quick preinvestigation check is helpful to further
improve the uptime estimation of the initial channels.
Once CLBOSS has some channels set up, it has time to
do more in-depth investigation of other proposals, especially
since it will use the reverse-the-direction trick using
offchain-to-onchain swaps (discussed in a previous writeup)
and will get more onchain funds to put into channels later,
which our next batch of proposals, now better-investigated,
will use.</p>

<h1>Investigation</h1>
<p>Once a proposal has passed through preinvestigation, we
hand it over to
<code>Boss::Mod::ChannelCandidateInvestigator</code>.</p>
<p>The investigator keeps a list of proposals under
investigation on-disk, in the common CLBOSS database.
Each candidate entry contains a <code>proposal</code>, a
<code>patron</code>, and an <code>onlineness</code> score.
Candidates must have unique <code>proposal</code> nodes.</p>
<p>The <code>onlineness</code> score starts at 0 and is
bounded from -3 to 24.</p>
<p>The investigator primarily triggers on the
<code>Boss::Msg::TimerRandomHourly</code> message.
It then gathers up to 8 randomly-selected candidates (or all
of them if there are less than 8).</p>
<p>The investigator then starts a connection to each of the
selected candidate <code>proposal</code>s.
If connection succeeds, its <code>onlineness</code> is
increased by one, otherwise the <code>onlineness</code>
is decremented.
If a node goes below -3, it is removed from the list of
candidates.
If the node goes above 24, then score saturates to 24.</p>
<p>Later, when CLBOSS detects that we have funds we can
put into channels, we get all nodes with non-negative
<code>onlineness</code> scores, sorted from highest to
lowest score.
If all available nodes have negative scores, however, we
instead provide all of them (but still sorted according
to score).</p>
<p>In addition, every random-hour, if there are less than
8 candidates with non-negative <code>onlineness</code>
scores, we ask channel selection modules to provide more
candidates.
Even if there are 8 or more candidates with non-negative
score, at random, the investigator might also ask for more as
well, with the probability of asking for more going down
with more non-negative score candidates.
On the other hand, if there are more than 32 candidates
already, we drop one selected at random.</p>
<p>Investigation is not performed if we are offline
according to the
<code>Boss::Mod::InternetConnectionMonitor</code>.
Otherwise, if we are offline then investigation will
always fail and we would unfairly demerit the selected
candidates, when it is actually a problem on our side.
However, the drop-candidates-if-too-many and
get-more-candidates behavior still remains triggered
at the random-hourly trigger even if we are offline,
as channel selection can be performed offline as long
as we have already downloaded the gossip map.</p>
