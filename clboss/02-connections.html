<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This writeup is of interest primarily to node operators.
Though some programming is mentioned, even those without
programming experience should be able to gather useful
information from this writeup.</p>
<p>In order to participate in the Lightning Network, your
node must first be able to actually <em>connect</em> to the
network.</p>
<p>This writeup will discuss three CLBOSS tasks related to
connecting to the Lightning Network:</p>
<p><ul>
 <li>Tracking Internet connectivity.</li>
 <li>Connecting to Lightning Network peers.</li>
 <li>Disconnecting from Lightning Network peers.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Note that this writeup will talk about <em>connecting</em>
to peers, and <em>not</em> making channels to them.
CLBOSS separates the two concepts.
First, the node needs to connect to the network so that the
node can perform an initial download of the network map.
Then when the map is available, other algorithms will
figure out where to make channels to.</p>
<p><em>This</em> writeup is about the connecting to the
network, not about opening channels to the network.
This distinction is vital to some of my goals for CLBOSS.</p>

<h1>Internet Connection Tracking</h1>
<p>Before we can connect to other nodes on the network, we
need to be connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>In particular, CLBOSS also monitors our channel peers for
their uptime, and may optionally close channels with peers
whose uptime is very low.
However, if it is <em>us</em> that actually has no
Internet connectivity, CLBOSS should discount the apparently
low uptime of our peers, since their perceived uptime will be
low due to us not being able to contact them, because it is
<em>us</em> that is actually down.</p>
<p>Just because the CLBOSS is running, presumably as a plugin
of some C-Lightning node, does not mean that the Internet
connection is working.
If your ISP is like mine, then sometimes you just get no
service at all for no reason.
Thus, CLBOSS also monitors the Internet connectivity, not
just its own uptime.</p>
<p>The <code>Boss::Mod::InternetConnectionMonitor</code> is the
module responsible for checking Internet connectivity.
Every 10 minutes, it performs a series of tests in order to
determine if the Internet is accessible.
If one test succeeds, then we consider ourselves to be
online.
Otherwise, it proceeds to the next test.</p>
<p><ol>
 <li><p>If there is at least one connected peer, then select
        one at random and send a Lightning-level <code>ping</code>
        to it.
        If it responds within 30.0 seconds, we consider ourself
        to be online.
        Otherwise if <code>ping</code> fails (for example if
        the peer disconnected between when we saw it in the list
        of peers and when we send the <code>ping</code> request,
        i.e. time-of-check-vs-time-of-use race), or we reach the
        30-second timeout, we assume this test fails and
        proceed to the next test.</p>
     <p>The Lightning BOLT protocol has its own <code>ping</code>
        message, which should be responded to by a Lightning BOLT
        protocol <code>pong</code> message.
        This is different from the ICMP-level <code>ping</code>
        you might be familiar with.
        C-Lightning exposes a <code>ping</code> command on the
        <code>lightning-rpc</code>, which is what CLBOSS
        uses.</p>
     <p>Nodes are not obligated to respond to
        <code>ping</code> requests, so this potentially
        could hang indefinitely.
        Thus, the 30-second timeout.</p>
     <p>Due to the way Internet packets work, our local OS
        might assume the connection is still live, but if
        no activity occurs on the connection, it might
        already be disconnected without our local OS
        realizing it.
        Sending an application-level <code>ping</code>
        allows us to notice this.
        If the selected peer is properly coded (such as C-Lightning)
        then it should be able to respond to <code>ping</code>
        messages with a <code>pong</code> in a few dozen
        milliseconds.
        If it instead times out, it is likely that the connection
        has gotten interrupted somewhere.</p></li>
 <li><p>Select one of a hardcoded set of https servers,
        including popular sites such as <code>www.google.com</code>
        and <code>www.alibaba.com</code>, which are unlikely
        to ever go offline, then try to connect to them.
        If we can connect, we consider ourselves online, otherwise
        we move to the next attempt below.</p>
     <p>CLBOSS only does the TCP-level connect to the port,
        but drops the connection as soon as it is established,
        to reduce load on the target server.
        We do not even start SSL tunnel handshaking, just the
        TCP-level connection establishment is enough for us to
        consider ourselves online.
        Connection is done over a proxy if the C-Lightning node
        has a proxy configured (and C-Lightning assumes the
        proxy is Tor, which CLBOSS also assumes);
        this improves the privacy of the node under management
        if it is configured with a Tor proxy.</p>
     <p>Because we want to support using a (Tor) proxy as above,
        we cannot use an ICMP-level <code>ping</code>.
        The proxy C-Lightning supports is SOCKS5h, meaning it
        can do a standard DNS lookup and do a connect to a
        hostname or IP address, but cannot do an ICMP-level
        <code>ping</code> via proxy (and Tor, which is the
        proxy we expect to use, does not support this at the
        Tor protocol level).
        Besides, ICMP access requires root on most Unixen, and
        we <strong>really</strong> do not want CLBOSS to run
        root.
        We <em>could</em> call into the system <code>ping</code>
        command, but what if it is not installed, also the
        <code>ping</code> command output has no standard (various
        OSs will have various conventions for its output and
        flags).</p>
     <p>We just want to check that we can connect to the Internet,
        not DoS the listed servers.
        Thus, we <em>frst</em> try to <code>ping</code> one of
        our peers, above, before we fall back to trying to
        connect to a hardcoded server.
        We also try only one of the servers listed, to distribute
        the load among them; as of this writing (mid 2022) we have
        about two dozen servers hardcoded.<em></em></p></li>
 <li><p>If the above selected server fails, we then try <em>all</em>
        the hardcoded servers.
        If we can connect to <em>any</em> of them, we consider ourselves
        online.</p>
     <p>If we are really disconnected from the Internet, then trying
        all the hardcoded servers will not affect any of them (because
        <em>we</em> are offline), so this is not a DoS attack, either.</p>
     <p>However, there is a tiny probability that one of these hugely
        popular servers is down, but the rest of the Internet is
        somehow still accessible to us.
        It is also possible that the local ISP or government or whatever
        of the node under management wants to censor one of these
        servers, but the rest of the Interent is still accessible.
        Hence this fallback.</p></li>
</ol></p>
<p>Note that the above tests are done every 10 minutes if
we think we are online.
If we think we are offline, we do the tests every 5 seconds
instead; if we are really offline, then checking every 5
seconds is not a DoS attack since we are offline.
However, this lets us know much more quickly if we are online.</p>
<p><code>Boss::Mod::InternetConnectionMonitor</code> will then
broadcast <code>Boss::Msg::InternetOnline</code>.
This messsage has a single <code>.online</code> field, which is
<code>true</code> if we are online and <code>false</code> if we
are offline.
This message is sent only if we changed from offline to online,
or online to offline; we assume at CLBOSS startup that we are
offline, and also do a check as soon as CLBOSS starts up, in case
we are actually online.
Other modules will then listen for the
<code>Boss::Msg::InternetOnline</code> message and update their
own local variable tracking onlineness.</p>
<p>If we moved from offline to online, then
<code>Boss::Mod::InternetConnectionMonitor</code> will also
broadcast <code>Boss::Msg::NeedsConnect</code>.
Due to CLBOSS starting with the state &ldquo;offline&rdquo;
and then immediately checking if we actually have Internet
connectivity, this behavior also handles the case where a new
CLBOSS is set up to manage a C-Lightning node.</p>
</p>This leads to the next section, where we describe how we
select nodes to actually connect to.</p>

<h1>Connecting to Lightning Network Nodes</h1>
<p>In order to <em>channel</em> to the network, first we have
to <em>connect</em> to the network.</p>
<p>Connecting to the network allows us to get the very
important network map via the gossip protocol.
Without the map, we cannot route payments, and more
importantly, the network map is one of the resources we
use to discover nodes we want to make channels to.</p>
<p>The <code>Boss::Mod::NeedsConnectSolicitor</code> module
reacts to the <code>Boss::Msg::NeedsConnect</code> message.
As of this writing (mid 2022) this message is broadcast in
two conditions.
One of them was described in the previous section: it is
raised when we move from &ldquo;offline&rdquo; to
&ldquo;online&rdquo;.
The other will be described in a subsection.</p>
<p>When <code>Boss::Mod::NeedsConnectSolicitor</code>
finds that we need to connect, it <dfn>solicits</dfn>
for connection candidates on the bus.
This means it broadcasts a message on the bus, which
other modules should respond to by broadcasting a
providing moessage.
This allows the soliciting module to be extended in
the future by adding new modules that provide
information to the soliciting module.</p>
<p><code>Boss::Mod::NeedsConnectSolicitor</code>
broadcasts a <code>Boss::Msg::SolicitConnectCandidates</code>
message to solict potential connection candidates from
other modules, then processes
<code>Boss::Msg::ProposeConnectCandidates</code> messages
from other modules, adding them to a set of candidates.</p>
<p>Then it takes this set of candidates and shuffles them,
distributing them into two queues.</p>
<p>It then processes both queues, trying candidates one at a
time.
If we are able to connect to a candidate, we finish processing
for that queue.
Otherwise, we move to the next candidate on the queue.</p>
<p>As of this writing (mid 2022), the following modules
propose candidates:</p>
<p><ul>
 <li><code>Boss::Mod::ConnectFinderByHardcode</code> &mdash;
     propose two nodes at random from a hardcoded list of
     nodes.</li>
 <li><code>Boss::Mod::ConnectFinderByDns</code> &mdash;
     selects a BOLT 10 DNS server from a harcoded list,
     then proposes the list of nodes and IP addresses the
     DNS server provides.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>These have important privacy concerns and eclipsing
concerns.</p>
<p>If we rely only on the DNS servers, we should note that
there are only a small number of entities running BOLT 10
DNS servers.
It is thus possible for all of them to be taken over so
that the servers return only nodes from a curated list,
effectively eclipsing the real network and censoring the
Lightning Network.
Thus, we also rely on a hardcoded list of nodes, in the
hope that even if the DNS servers are taken over, perhaps
one or more of the hardcoded list is not taken over.</p>
<p>Of course, since CLBOSS is open-source, someone who
wants to eclipse the network could also look at the
open-source hardcoded list of nodes, <em>and</em>
target them for takeover.
I have thus taken the effort to find nodes from various
countries, with various political systems, so that it is
difficult to take all of them over.
Nodes in Western democracies still dominate the list,
however.</p>
<p>Sometimes a node on the list shuts down permanently.
Thus, once or twice a year I go over the list and try
to connect to them manually.
If they are offline, I remove them from the list.
Then I add more nodes on this hardcoded list.</p>
<p>Most ISPs have awful default DNS resolvers.
For example, <code>lseed.darosior.ninja</code> is often
unusable from my ISP default DNS resolver.
For this reason, I also hardcode a reliable DNS resolver
together with the actual BOLT 10 DNS server.</p>
<p>A problem here is that the DNS resolver you use gets
to know your IP address.
Thus, if a Tor proxy is configured, we use DNS-over-TCP,
and use the <code>torify</code> command to wrap TCP
access over Tor.
Note that Tor itself only supports TCP transport, so we
have to specifically use DNS-over-TCP, and not whatever
UDP-based protocol DNS uses by default (I know less about
DNS than I ever thought I did).</p>
<h2>The Reconnector</h2>
<p>Most node software, it seems, expect connections to be
&ldquo;used&rdquo;, by which they mean that they expect
channels to be made some time after you connect to them.
If you connect to them, but after some time, do not make a
channel, they will disconnect.</p>
<p>However, it is important for CLBOSS to not become a
<dfn>kingmaker</dfn>, i.e. if many people start run CLBOSS
near-simultaneously, no single node on the network should
suddenly get more unmerited channels and / or payment
traffic, as that hurts decentralization and makes the
position of such a &ldquo;king&rdquo; into a target for
those who want to monitor or control the Lightning Network.
Thus, just because CLBOSS, for example, hardcodes some
node in its list of nodes, it should not have special
bonuses in being considered up for channelling.</p>
<p>This means that
<code>Boss::Mod::ConnectFinderByHardcode</code> is likely
to connect to a node, but the rest of CLBOSS will decide
not to make a channel with it after all (since the
hardcoded nodes should not be promoted more to avoid
becoming a kingmaker).</p>
<p>If that node then decides that you not making a
channel with them means they should disconnect from
you, then a CLBOSS-managed node can end up with no
connections, returning us back to our pre-managed
state where C-Lightning just sits there twiddling its
thumbs.</p>
<p>Thus, CLBOSS has the <code>Boss::Mod::Reconnector</code>
,odule.
This module simply listens for disconnection notices from
the node under management, and then checks if the node
has no more connections.
If the node loses its last connection, it raises the
<code>Boss::Msg::NeedsConnect</code> message to find more
nodes to connect to, so that the node always has some
connections.</p>

<h1>Disconnecting From Lightning Network Nodes</h1>
<p><em>One</em> purpose for connecting to the network is
to download an up-to-date gossip map, so that we can run
our heuristics that use the map as reference in order to
make channels with.</p>
<p>However, there are also other reasons for CLBOSS To
connect.</p>
<p>A later writeup will delve into more detail, but in
addition to the
<code>Boss::Mod::NeedsConnectSolicitor</code> module,
another module <em>also</em> connects to nodes.
The purpose for this connection is to determine the
uptime of other nodes; if we are able to connect to
such nodes, then we can judge that the remote node has
high uptime (probably).</p>
<p>This means in particular that once the node has a
good amount of the gossip map, CLBOSS will start
connecting to many nodes, due to checking their uptime.</p>
<p>However, keeping up-to-date with the gossip, once
you have already downloaded much of the gossip map,
should not require more than a few live connections.</p>
<p>Thus, the <code>Boss::Mod::AutoDisconnector</code>
module will limit the number of connections.
This triggers every 10 minutes.
If there are more than 3 connections without channels,
then it will select all but three of them at random,
and disconnect the selected ones.</p>
<p>Connections to peers <em>with</em> channels are
ignored by <code>Boss::Mod::AutoDisconnector</code>.
Connections to those peers are needed to keep up to
date with the status of the channel, and to be
ready for any forwards via that channel.</p>
<p>The combination of
<code>Boss::Mod::Reconnector</code> and
<code>Boss::Mod::AutoDisconnector</code> ensures that
the node has between 1 to 3 connections to nodes that
it has no channels with, which helps propagate gossip.
This is important in case your peers-with-channels
are trying to do an eclipse attack on you and trying
to prevent knowledge about some node from you (for
example, if somebody actually owns a large number of
nodes on the network, and wants to redirect payments
to go through their nodes by denying knowledge of
gossip about other nodes from your node).
At the same time, it also keeps the number of
&ldquo;useless&rdquo; connections (i.e. those without
channels) low.</p>
