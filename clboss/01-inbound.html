<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This writeup is of interest to node operators and Lightning
Network wallet end-users, even those without programming
experience.</p>
<p>Inbound liquidity is, somehow, always a concern for the
Lightning Network.
It is trivial for a new node to get outbound liquidity by
simply allocating some onchain funds to new channels to the
rest of the network.
But for some reason, it is apparently a difficult task to
acquire inbound liquidity.</p>
<p>Or in other words, it is easy for a new LN wallet to
<em>send</em> funds, but hard for a new LN wallet to
<em>receive</em> funds.
Somehow, an LN wallet has to get this thing called
&ldquo;inbound liquidity&rdquo; in order to actually
<em>receive</em> funds.</p>

<h1>Non-CLBOSS Solutions</h1>
<p>The market around LN has come up with a few solutions
to this problem:</p>
<p><ul>
 <li>Custodial wallets.
     An expert node operator contacts other, existing
     nodes to request incoming liquidity from them, or
     otherwise acquire incoming liquidity on their own
     node.
     Then that operator sells the LN wallet service (both
     outbound and inbound liquidity) of their node to
     end-users, in exchange for knowledge of all their LN
     payments, and the irrevocable and very transferable
     right to steal all their LN funds at any time.</li>
 <li>LSPs offering services to make channels to new
     LN wallets and give them incoming liquidity.
     This service can be paid for explicitly by charging a
     direct fee for the incoming liquidity, <em>or</em>
     implicitly by requiring an unpublished (often called
     oxymoronically as &ldquo;private&rdquo;) channel
     (thus getting knowledge of all LN sends and receives
     via that channel, as per axiom of terminus),
     <em>or</em> again implicitly by charging usurious
     offchain feerates for use of the channel.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The above solutions usually have negative implications
for the privacy and security of your LN funds and fund
transfers.</p>
<p>More recently (mid 2022), Lisa Neigut has been designing
dual-funding, also known as &ldquo;openchannelv2&rdquo;.
This largely makes the LSP-solution above much easier.
The dual-funding protocol also includes the liquidity ads
sub-proposal, which further facilitates the above
LSP-solution.
Liquidity ads encourages the explicit charge for a published
channel rather than implicit fees from reselling information
extracted from unpublished (laughably known as
&ldquo;private&rdquo;) channels, or charging usurious
feerates.</p>
<p>Fundamentally speaking, we can consider both approaches
as &ldquo;selling inbound liquidity&rdquo;.
The sellers of the inbound liquidity are able to acquire
inbound liquidity for their own nodes, and then let you
purchase the use of that inbound liquidity.
Typically, this inbound liquidity is acquired wholesale by
direct dealings with operators of large published nodes,
often operated or owned by existing Bitcoin whales.
The inbound liquidity is then resold at retail to smaller
individual end-users.</p>
<p>However, it is a better proposition for the inbound
liquidity to be sold for a monetary fee, then to pay using
your information.
Information about you can be used to manipulate and
control you in order to extract tribute from you later.
Thus, solutions that involve end users paying for incoming
liquidity by sacrificing their information should be
avoided.</p>

<h2>Non-Custodiality And Privacy</h2>
<p>TLDR: non-custodial wallets that always connect to a
fixed LSP (or set of LSPs) are still no good in terms
of keeping your information safe, though as non-custodial
they do keep your actual funds safe.
The rest of this subsection is deeply technical.</p>
<p>Some developers of non-custodial LN wallets have
considered setting up their own LSP, and having their
non-custodial LN wallets always connect to that LSP.
The idea is that the developers also get their
inbound liquidity wholesale and then provide it
&ldquo;for free&rdquo; to end-users, while using
non-custodial techniques so that their node never holds
end-user funds.</p>
<p>However, if your non-custodial wallet always connects
to one or more LSP(s) run by a single entity, then you
are paying for its services using your information:
the LSP knows that all transfers on your channels with
it are your activity, because your non-custodial wallet
<em>cannot</em> connect to anyone else.
(If the wallet can in theory connect to &ldquo;your own
node!&rdquo; then just run your own published node and
use a mobile remote control UI to that published node,
instead of controlling your own node by tying up more
Bitcoins into a channel from your mobile non-custodial
wallet, which you own, to your own node, which you also
own, so all transfers between them are of null utility
since you own both nodes anyway, so just use a remote
control instead and avoid tying up more funds.)</p>
<p>No amount of promising from these developers can
truly protect your information.
In particular, with the LN as of mid 2022, it is
impossible to delete the information even if the
operators really really really want to: Poon-Dryja
channel operators <em><strong>MUST</strong></em> keep a
copy of every HTLC that ever existed on a channel,
otherwise old state could have an old HTLC that cannot
be retrieved since the hash and timelock details are
not known.
The HTLC data can only be safely deleted if the channel
is closed (at which point you lose access to the LN).
You might trust them <em>now</em>, but their values may
change in the future, they or their employer may be
bought out by some entity with very different values,
their LSP can be hacked and the information stolen,
etc.</p>
<p>In theory the non-custodial LN wallet developers
could release the code for their LSP so that anyone
<em>else</em> can run an LSP as well.
While better than fixing your non-custodial wallet to
use LSP(s) from a single entity, we should compare
this to the situation with Electrum servers.
Electrum servers do <em>not</em> require that the
server operators lock up funds for the Electrum server,
so it is far easier for a random nameless volunteer to
run one, whereas LSPs should be large published nodes
or else their capacity may be overwhelmed.
LSPs need to somehow acquire the inbound liquidity
wholesale (again, often by directly dealing with other
large published nodes) that they will provide to the
end-users.
It is certainly possible to do so, but the barriers
are higher than for Electrum servers, and the
undeletable log data is still a problem.</p>

<h1>Inbound Liquidity Via Offchain-to-Onchain Swaps</h1>
<p>During the blocksize debate, one of the points against
the Lightning Network, and therefore the smallblock
strategy, was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Largeblocker: LN channels start in one direction only
and you cannot receive by it!
That sucks!</p>
<p>Smallblocker: Well, if you send out funds first, then
you get inbound liquidity so you can then receive
afterwards.</p>
<p>Largeblocker: So I have to spend first before I can
receive??
Nice UX, LN!
What if I am not interested in spending my Bitcoins, I
just want to buy more Bitcoins so I have to receive it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, an important key insight was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Smallblocker: 1 BTC = 1 BTC.
You can spend Bitcoins on the Lightning Network to buy
an equivalent amount of Bitcoins on the blockchain, which
gets you inbound liquidity (due to sending out the funds
over the channel), while still keeping your Bitcoins as
Bitcoins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, you use an offchain-to-onchain swap service,
such as Boltz Exchange or Lightning Loop, and because you
send out funds over the LN, you get inbound liquidity.
At the same time, you can then take the onchain Bitcoins
and lock them into new channels, to return the same amount
into a readily-spendable outbound liquidity.</p>
<p>This has several advantages:</p>
<p><ul>
 <li>If you contact the swap service over Tor, and mix the
     received onchain coins using CoinJoin or CoinSwap, then
     the swap service cannot identify which node on the
     network is using their service to get inbound liquidity,
     thus cannot resell your information.</li>
 <li>You are not tied to specific LSPs, and you can connect
     channels to <em>any</em> published node on the network.
     This improves your decentralization and resilience, as
     there are far more published nodes than there are LSPs
     that sell inbound liquidity.</li>
 <li>You are distant from the swap service you are buying
     the inbound liquidity from, unlike the case of an LSP
     which <em>must</em> be your peer.
     The swap service is effectively transferring their
     inbound liquidity to you, not leasing their inbound
     liquidity (like in the LSP case).
     Once you have purchased the liquidity, the liquidity
     of the swap service no longer matters to you, and even
     if the swap servie manages to lose all inbound liquidity,
     you can still receive since you are distant from the
     swap service.
     Compare this to the LSP case, where if the LSP manages
     to lose inbound liquidity, even if you have channels
     with the LSP where the LSP can send to you, if the LSP
     itself cannot receive from the rest of the network, it
     cannot forward to you and you cannot receive via that
     LSP since it is your broker to the rest of the network.</li>
 <li>You can do this manually using e.g. the Boltz Exchange
     website, even if your LN wallet does not support it
     directly.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Strangely, this technique seems to be underutilized.
To my knowledge (mid 2022), only the Electrum LN wallet has
direct support for this technique, and provides a convenient
button on its UI to perform a swap for the purposes of
getting inbound liquidity.
CLBOSS also uses this technique to buy inbound liquidity,
and does so automatically when it judges that the node under
management has insufficient inbound liquidity.
People are somehow amazed at how CLBOSS can
&ldquo;magically&rdquo; get balanced channels with good
inbound and outbound liquidity, yet this technique can be
done perfectly manually and is very simple, both in concept
and execution.
CLBOSS just adds automation to do this technique without
user intervention.</p>
<p>The technique is not perfect.
You need Bitcoins to first create channels, then reverse the
direction of the channels via this offchain-to-onchain swap
technique, then create new channels to put your onchain
funds back offchain.
Typically, wallet developers wnat to demo their wallet by
first sending to prospective end-users some nominal amount
of funds, then show that it can be spent.
But this case can be handled by 0-conf <code>push_msat</code>
channels, and once you have a channel, you can reverse its
direction using this technique.</p>
<h2>Swap Service Point-of-View</h2>
<p>We might wonder about the point-of-view of the swap
service.</p>
<p>As far as the swap service knows, it is selling onchain
Bitcoins for offchain Bitcoins.</p>
<p>However, we should note that in order to <em>receive</em>
offchain Bitcoins over Lightning, the swap service itself
has to have its own inbound liquidity.</p>
<p>When the inbound liquidity is then subsequently used up
during the buying of onchain Bitcoins, then the swap service
has to somehow acquire new inbound liquidity and new onchain
Bitcoins.</p>
<p>How the service does so, will depend on the operators of
the service.
The swap service may have deals with other large LN node
operators to get inbound liquidity, and deals with miners
to get onchain Bitcoins.</p>
<p>Basically, this operation transfers the inbound liquidity
of the swap service over to the inbound liquidity of the
user of this technique.
The surcharge the swap service imposes then is the fee for
the purchase of this inbound liquidity.
Like in the LSP case, the node acquires inbound liquidity
wholesale, and then sells it at retail to end-users.</p>
<p>A difference between the swap service and the LSP case,
as noted above, is that the LSP is really renting out its
inbound liquidity to its clients.
For example, if the LSP has 1 BTC in inbound liquidity to
the rest of the network, it could offer 1 BTC of liquidity
to one client and <em>also</em> 1 BTC to another client.
It is gambling that the clients will not simultaneously
require the inbound liquidity, because if both of them
try to use the full, sold capacity of 1 BTC, then the
actual lack of liquidity of the LSP will prevent them from
receiving.</p>
<p>With the swap service instead, the swap service cannot
sell inbound liquidity it does not have.
If the swap service has only 1 BTC of inbound liquidity,
then if one client purchases that 1 BTC of inbound liquidity
(by paying it for onchain Bitcoins, which converts the
client outbound liquidity to inbound liquidity and the swap
service inbound liquidity to outbound liquidity) then the
swap service cannot sell the same 1 BTC of inbound
liquidity to another client later, since it no longer has
any inbound liquidity to sell.</p>
<p>With the use of a swap service rather than an LSP, the
clients do not need to audit the inbound liquidity of
the swap service, whereas with the LSP, the clients need
to monitor and audit the inbound liquidity of the LSP.
Unfortunately, the liquidity of the LSP represents private
information of the LSP, and it is unsafe for the LSP to
share this information.</p>
<br />
<p><img src='01-inbound-lsp-example.svg' /></p>
<p>1) LSP sells 2 BTC of inbound liquidity, despite only
having 1 BTC of inbound liquidity.
2) Client 1 consumes its 1 BTC of inbound liquidity,
which also consumes the 1 BTC of inbound liquidity of
the LSP.
Client 2 <em>thinks</em> it still has 1 BTC of inbound
liquidity, but actually cannot receive except from
Client 1.</p>
<br />
<p><img src='01-inbound-swap-example.svg' /></p>
<p>1) Client 1 and Client 2 connect to the Lightning Network,
where Swap is offerring an offchain-to-onchain swap service.
2) Client 1 outright purchases the available inbound liquidity
from Swap.
Client 2 is unable to purchase the inbound liquidity from
Swap, but <em>knows</em> it has no inbound liquidity.
Client 2 can choose to use a different Swap service, without
having to close the existing channel it already made.</p>
<br />
<h2>CLBOSS Swap Decisionmaking</h2>
<p>CLBOSS is an automated manager, so it has to have
<em>some</em> policy on when to trigger a swap.
In CLBOSS as of this writing (mid 2022) there are two
conditions that would cause an offchain-to-onchain swap.</p>
<p><ul>
 <li><code>Boss::Mod::NodeBalanceSwapper</code>: triggers
     by comparing the inbound liquidity versus the total
     of the inbound and outbound liquidity.
     If the inbound liquidity is less than 30% of the total,
     and onchain fees are low, it triggers a swap.
     If the inbound liquidity is less than 2.5% of the total,
     it triggers a swap even if onchain fees are high.
     This always sends out 2/3 of the difference between
     outbound and inbound liquidity.</li>
 <li><code>Boss::Mod::NeedsOnchainFundsSwapper</code>:
     triggers when a small amount of onchain funds is
     detected, but the amount is too small for a feasible
     practical channel.
     This will typically occur if for example a channel
     needs to get closed, and only a small amount of money
     happens to be on our side of the channel-to-close.
     Rather than HODL this money onchain, CLBOSS will
     try to make an offchain-to-onchain swap to get more
     onchain funds, and form a new, larger channel.
     This only triggers if onchain fees are low.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The main policy that buys inbound liquidity is the
<code>NodeBalanceSwapper</code> module.
However, <code>NeedsOnchainFundsSwapper</code> will,
effectively, preemptively buy inbound liquidity to
match a planned outbound liquidity when we later build a
new channel to the network.</p>
<h2>CLBOSS Swaps</h2>
<p>The swap system of CLBOSS has sufficient abstraction
that it can use any number of protocols to talk with the
swap service.
It also has the ability to use any number of actual
swap services.</p>
<p>However, as of this writing (mid 2022), only one
protocol is used, the Boltz protocol.
This is because the Boltz API is well-documented.</p>
<p>It would be nice to also support using the
Lightning Labs Lightning Loop.
However, it has the disadvantage that the client-server
API is undocumented other than the client Go code, and
there is no open-source implementation of the server,
only the client.
Boltz has released an open-source server code as
well, so in theory anyone can start up a new Boltz
server.</p>
<p>As noted, CLBOSS can use multiple swap services of
various protocols.
In particular, the open-source Boltz server means
that in theory multiple servers, run by different
entities, can arise which use the same protocol.
The CLBOSS code includes two swap services that both
use the Boltz protocol: the Boltz server itself, and
one run over a hidden service by AutonomousOrganization.
However, the latter service appears to be moribund,
and may be removed at some point in the future.</p>
<p>I encourage others to deploy new swap services,
rather than LSPs.</p>
<p>CLBOSS immediately sends onchain funds directly
to the node under management.
This means that the swap service can learn who is
using its services by simply observing the blockchain
and seeing the funds it sent out onchain being spent
into channels of a specific node.
At some point in the future, it would be nice to add
the option to use some kind of CoinJoin or CoinSwap
service to separate the funds from the swap service,
and prevent the swap service from reselling that
information.
In particular, an LSP <em>has to</em> know your
node in order to give you inbound liquidity, while
at least with a swap service, there is a way for
you to hide your node from the swap service, it
just has not been implemented on CLBOSS yet
(mid 2022).</p>
<p>Even with the lack of privacy against swap
service in practice (since CLBOSS does not yet
use an anonymizing layer to protect your identity
from the swap service), there is still a slight
advantage.
The swap service will learn your node after-the-fact,
when it has already given you the inbound liquidity,
and once it has learned your node, cannot revoke that
inbound liquidity it has given to you.
The LSP has to know your node before-the-fact and
can deny you the inbound liquidity in the first
place, <em>and</em> can close the channel
after-the-fact if it changes its mind about you.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Addendum: &ldquo;Private&rdquo; Channels Are Not Private: Unpublished Channels Delenda Est</h1>
<p>Commonly referred to by the misnomer &ldquo;private
channel&rdquo;, unpublished channels leak your every
offchain send and receive to your counterparty.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple: only those who know
the channel can use it for their payments.</p>
<p>If your channel is unpublished, then only two
people know the channel: you and your LSP.</p>
<p>If the channel has activity, and the LSP is not
the one that triggered that activity, then by process of
elimination, it knows that <em>you</em> are the one
using the channel for that activity.
After all, only the two of you know the channel.
In that case, it can assign with 100% probability
those activity to you, and resell that information
to others.</p>
<p>If you value your privacy and your right to not
have your information resold, then use published
channels.</p>
<p>Now you might quibble and say &ldquo;yes but I
could use the unpublished channel in an invoice so
the channel is now known by another entity&rdquo;.
But if you are going to rely on that, <em>just publish
the channel outright in the first place</em>.
That increases your anonymity set to &ldquo;all
LN users&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The axiom of terminus is just the observation
that an unpublished channel can only be used at
the start or the end of a payment route, and not
at any intermediate hop.
Thus, any observer along the route who sees a
multihop payment route from or to an unpublished
channel knows immediately that the route starts
or stops at the node at the other end.
This is just a reformulation of the above
observation, that an unpublished channel is
known only by two entities and if one entity
sees activity and knows it is not using the
channel, obviously the activity was from the
other entity.</p>
